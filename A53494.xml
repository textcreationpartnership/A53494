            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>YOu are no more able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your ſelf from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of a dedication, than you were, in your ſingle Perſon, to ſtem the dreadful deluge of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which very lately brought <hi>Old England</hi> within an Hair's breadth of that utter Ruin that was manifeſtly impending.</p>
            <p>Indeed, when I firſt took the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of inſcribing your <hi>honoured Name,</hi> to the firſt part of my <hi>Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> I purpoſed to have petitioned your Licence ſo to do; but at the time when the thing was finiſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:35279:3"/>I was at ſuch a great diſtance from you, that I had not opportunity to do it, and therefore (being no near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to you at this time) I do implore your Pardon for my Preſumption therein, and for my repeating that Tranſgreſſion; and do hope that you will the more readily grant it; when I have made this publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement to the World (in caſe any thing I have ſaid be deemed offenſive, which I hope there cannot) that <hi>Sr Samuel Barnardiſton</hi> was no way privy to the writing of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or of this <hi>Second</hi> part of theſe <hi>Stories;</hi> and that I can <hi>(upon very good ground)</hi> ſay, that he doth not, to this day, know who is the <hi>Collector</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Sir! He who is not allowed to uſe a <hi>Sword</hi> in his <hi>Countries quarrel,</hi> may ſurely be indulged in crying out <hi>Murder,</hi> Treaſon; when he ſees a <hi>Piſtol at his Prince's head,</hi> or a <hi>Dagger</hi> at his <hi>Heart;</hi> and having, with grief, beheld that very ſame
<pb facs="tcp:35279:3"/>
               <hi>Toryiſm,</hi> which murder'd the beſt of Men, my good <hi>Lord Ruſſell,</hi> and many others of our beſt <hi>Patriots;</hi> to be <hi>rampant</hi> and <hi>impudent;</hi> and as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilably bent againſt the <hi>true Government of England,</hi> which the glorious and moſt <hi>miraculous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Heaven,</hi> has lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon our undoubted right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> as it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our late <hi>bleſſed Martyrs</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh Liberties;</hi> I could not withhold my ſelf from attempting the ſervice of my Generation (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my mean capacity) in expoſing thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi> which but t'other day had brought the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to the very brink of irreparable ruin; eſpecially, when I ſee at this very day, <hi>the Men who had ſuck'd in that Poiſon, Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Plotting</hi> (not to <hi>allure,</hi> but) <hi>to dragoon us into</hi> French Bondage.</p>
            <p>The truth of it is <hi>(Sr.)</hi> I was much irritated to the proſecution of this Work, by what I met with in
<pb facs="tcp:35279:4"/>my return from the late <hi>Tryal of Skill</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> when thoſe moſt worthy Gentlemen, <hi>Colonel Mildmay</hi> and Sr. <hi>Fran.

            <p>I had the <hi>Promiſe (and ſo I thought aſſurance)</hi> of ſome things, at leaſt as valuable, as the beſt things in this Tract can be eſteemed to be; but <hi>ſome Men are too zealouſly intent and buſie in their private Affairs, to be publick-ſpirited</hi> (though I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:35279:7"/>the time when they were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſo) &amp; therefore, <hi>(to touch that Point no further at preſent)</hi> I ſhall only ſay, I have done <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t potui;</hi> and wiſh that ſome other Perſon, who could have done this to more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage had undertaken the <hi>Task;</hi> I am <hi>(what I alwayes was, and ever will be)</hi>

            <p>That, in theſe Extremities, they had nothing under <hi>God</hi> to comfort them, but the hopes that the <hi>King</hi> (<hi>touch'd with the Groans of his periſhing</hi> People) would have ſuffered the <hi>Parliament</hi> to meet, at the day to which it was prorogued; and no further interruption ſhould be given to their Proceedings, in order to the ſaving the <hi>Nation:</hi> But, that that failed them too, for the <hi>King,</hi> by the private ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of <hi>Wicked Perſons, Favourers of</hi> Popery, <hi>Promoters of</hi> French <hi>deſigns, and Enemies to the King and Kingdom</hi>

            <p>Mr <hi>Evans</hi> added, that upon the 17th of <hi>July,</hi> Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> and Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> found him in a <hi>Coffee-Houſe;</hi> and Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> then told him, that Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> had been with him, examining his <hi>Son</hi> about a <hi>Razour</hi> that was thrown out of the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> his Window.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Edwards</hi> teſtified, that about ten of the Clock, the day of the <hi>Earl's</hi> death, he was informed by his Family; and by his Son, that ſame day at noon, that his Son came from the <hi>Tower</hi> about ten of the Clock, and ſaid, that he had ſeen the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke,</hi> and that the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> had cut his own Throat; and that the <hi>Boy</hi> ſaw an hand throw a <hi>Razour</hi> out of the Window; and a <hi>Maid</hi> in a white Hood came out of the Houſe and took it up, and then go in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and that he heard a noiſe as of Murder cryed out.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Edwards</hi> acknowledged, that he told ſeveral at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> the ſame
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35279:16"/>day, what the <hi>Lad</hi> had declared; and that Mr <hi>Bradden</hi> came not to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry about it, till <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17th of <hi>July;</hi> before which time he never knew Mr <hi>Braddon;</hi> that he then told him what report the <hi>Boy</hi> brought home; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the <hi>Boy</hi> never denyed it before Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> came, but did afterwards that ſame day deny it, as his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Daughter</hi> informed him; his Siſter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put him into fear about it; and that Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> did not deſire the <hi>Boy</hi> to give it under his hand, till he had been there two or three times.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William Edwards</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> aged 13 years, was then ſworn (his <hi>Father</hi> like a very honeſt Man charging him in the preſence of <hi>Almighty God</hi> to ſay nothing but the truth) he ſaid, that he told his <hi>Father</hi> that he ſaw an Hand caſt out a <hi>bloody Razour,</hi> and a Maid come out and take it up, and go in again. That Mr <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> asked him what he ſaw at the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that he told him as he had told his <hi>Father;</hi> and that Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> bad him ſpeak the truth, and wrote down what he told him, and nothing more; and then read it to him; and ask'd him whether it were true, and that he told
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35279:16"/>him, that all that was in the Paper was true, and that he then put his Name to it.</p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Chief Juſtice and King's Counſel</hi> interrogating him, he ſaid, that he did at firſt refuſe to put his Name to it, becauſe he was afraid of coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to danger; and being further preſſed, he added, that the reaſon why he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed danger was, becauſe what was in the Paper was not true; but conſeſſed that he did not tell <hi>Mr B.</hi> that it was not true, but that his <hi>Mother</hi> was afraid to have him ſign it; and declared, upon the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion put to him, that <hi>Mr B.</hi> did not offer or promiſe him any Money.</p>

Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> ſuggeſted, that they were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole Morning, and that there was no ſuch thing of the <hi>Razour,</hi> as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> had declared; but this <hi>Lad</hi> only teſtified that <hi>young Edwards</hi> and he, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the <hi>Tower,</hi> as long as the <hi>King</hi> walked; &amp; that when the <hi>King</hi> went into the <hi>Conſtable's</hi> Houſe, they went to play, &amp; after their play, he left <hi>Edwards</hi> &amp; went
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35279:17"/>home; and that after he had been there a little time, <hi>news</hi> was brought to his <hi>Father,</hi> that the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> had killed himſelf; and that thereupon his <hi>Father</hi> went down, and he followed; and after he had been a little while there, <hi>William Edwards</hi> came, and they ſtood looking up at the Window an hour or two; and went away together; and that he ſaw no <hi>Razeur</hi> thrown out.</p>
            <p>Upon this Mr <hi>A. General,</hi> in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful way ſaid, <hi>My Lord,</hi> This ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour began in a <hi>Fanatick Family;</hi> he might have been juſtly anſwered, that <hi>Mr Edwards</hi> his Family, was, and is of as good reputation as one certain <hi>Doctor's</hi> (not to vie with more) where the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling of ſuch Evidence as ran againſt the Stream, had been ſome Years before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly practiſed.</p>
            <p>But to return to the matter in hand, is it not moſt evident, that <hi>Mr Attorney</hi> was not rightly inſtructed; For 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the <hi>Lads</hi> were parted when the Murder was committed, and the <hi>Razour</hi> thrown out; the <hi>young Doctor</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that he was in his <hi>Father's</hi> Houſe, when the news of the <hi>Earl's</hi> death came; and then went with his <hi>Father</hi> to the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35279:17"/>place; and 'tis more then probable, that in the crowd and diſtraction, which muſt neceſſarily be there, he might not at his firſt coming ſee young <hi>Edwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Mr <hi>Blathwayte</hi> and Mr <hi>Mon-Stevens</hi> (the <hi>Earl of Sunderland</hi>'s Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary) were called and ſworn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Blathwayte</hi> appeared, rather as an <hi>Advocate,</hi> than a <hi>Witneſs,</hi> againſt <hi>Mr Braddon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They teſtified Mr <hi>Braddon</hi>'s bringing the <hi>Information</hi> of young <hi>Edwards,</hi> to my <hi>Lord Sunderland</hi> the <hi>Secretary's</hi> Office, and that <hi>Edwards</hi> declared before the <hi>King,</hi> that what was contained therein was not true, and yet Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> would proſecute it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Information</hi> was then read, to this following effect, <hi>July</hi> the 18th 1683.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Informant ſaith, that on</hi> Friday <hi>the</hi> 13th <hi>inſtant, he heard that the</hi> King <hi>and the</hi> Duke of York, <hi>were going to the</hi> Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; <hi>and that he went thither to ſee them; and then went about nine of the Clock, to ſee the</hi> Lord Brandon's <hi>Lodgings, and as he was ſtanding between theſe Lodgings, and the</hi> Earl of Eſſex<hi>'s, he ſaw an Hand caſt out a bloody</hi> Razour <hi>out of the</hi> Earl's Lodgings,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35279:18"/>
               <hi>and he was going to take it up, but before he come to it, there came a</hi> Maid <hi>running out of</hi> Captain Hawley's <hi>Houſe where the</hi> Earl <hi>ledged, and took up the</hi> Razour, <hi>and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it into the Houſe; and the</hi> Informant <hi>believes it was the ſame</hi> Maid, <hi>which he firſt heard to cry out</hi> Murder; <hi>and ſaith, that he heard the</hi> Maid <hi>ſay to ſome about the Door, after Minder was cryed, that ſhe heard the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>groan three times that Morning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Henry Capel</hi> was then produced to thew, as the <hi>Council</hi> urged, that <hi>Mr Braddon</hi> proſecuted this matter on his head.</p>
            <p>He teſtified that <hi>Mr Braddon</hi> was twice with him, and that he told <hi>Mr Braddon,</hi> that he was under great grief; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had to ſay in the matter, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint a <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> of <hi>State</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:35279:22"/>proceeded in his Evidence, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Girl's Aunt,</hi> Mrs <hi>Smyth,</hi> who witneſſed, that the <hi>Girl</hi> coming from the <hi>Tower,</hi> upon the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> told her, that ſhe ſaw a Razour thrown out of a Window, <hi/> and that Mr <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> hearing of it, came as a Stranger to enquire about it; and ever encouraged the <hi>Girl</hi> to ſpeak the truth; and bad her ſpeak nothing but what was truth; and that he never offered her or the <hi>Girl</hi> any thing.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>William Glasbrooke</hi> teſtified, That upon the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> he heard the <hi>Girl</hi> very loud with her <hi>Aunt,</hi> ſaying, the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> has cut his Throat in the <hi>Tower;</hi> and that her <hi>Aunt</hi> chiding her, <hi>ſhe</hi> ſaid, <hi>ſhe</hi> was ſure it was true, for <hi>ſhe</hi> ſaw a <hi>bloody Razour</hi> thrown out of the Window; and that he the ſaid <hi>Witneſs</hi> was preſent, when Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed the <hi>Girl;</hi> having never ſeen him before; and he heard her tell Mr <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> cut his Throat, and that <hi>ſhe</hi> ſaw a <hi>bloody Razour</hi> thrown out of the Window, and that ſhe heard two <hi>Groans,</hi> or two <hi>Shriekes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, Mr <hi>Smyth,</hi> being called by Mr <hi>Braddon,</hi> teſtified, that he went with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35279:23"/>Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> to the <hi>Girl,</hi> and heard her tell him, that <hi>ſhe</hi> ſaw an hand toſs a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour</hi> out at the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi>'s Lodgings; and that <hi>ſhe</hi> heard two <hi>Shriekes;</hi> and ſaw a <hi>Woman</hi> come out, with <hi>White head-Cloathes;</hi> but did not ſee any one take up the <hi>Razour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Meux</hi> was then produced by Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> to teſtifie, that <hi>ſhe</hi> went from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Berk-ſhire,</hi> the day before the <hi>Lord Ruſſell's Tryal;</hi> and that a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> in the <hi>Coach</hi> with her, then told her, that one of the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi> had cut his <hi>Throat.</hi> At this the quondam <hi>City Mouth,</hi> ſtorm'd and huff'd at his wonted rate, refuſing to hear the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and demanding why they brought not the <hi>Woman</hi> which told this to Mrs <hi>Meux;</hi> and was anſwered, that <hi>ſhe</hi> was ſo big with Child, that <hi>ſhe</hi> could not come.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Burgeſſe</hi> of <hi>Marlborough</hi> then teſtified, that he being at <hi>Froome</hi> (in <hi>Dorſet-ſhire</hi>) upon the day of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s death; he heard there, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> had murdered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>King's Council</hi> produced the <hi>Coroner</hi>'s well inſtructed <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35279:23"/>prove that this Noble <hi>Peer</hi> was <hi>Felo de ſe;</hi> who were <hi>Bomency</hi> (his <hi>Lordſhip's Servant,</hi> now in <hi>France,</hi> and a profeſſed <hi>Papiſt</hi>) <hi>Hawley,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſell</hi> the <hi>Warder,</hi> and <hi>Lloyd</hi> the <hi>Centinel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, becauſe the <hi>Depoſitions</hi> of theſe <hi>Fellows,</hi> will appear in their moſt true and beſt light, in the <hi>Abſtract</hi> of ſome of the proofs, made about this moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Aſſaſſination;</hi> which (<hi>with the leave of the candid and ingennons</hi> Abſtracter <hi>thereof</hi>) I purpoſe to ſubjoyn, I ſhall not here enlarge upon them.</p>
            <p>The Evidence on both ſides being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the laſt place comes <hi>Jeffryes,</hi> to deſcant and remark upon it, which he did in an harangue which makes ſix <hi>leafs</hi> in <hi>Folio;</hi> (<hi>half as many, as the</hi> Acts <hi>of all the</hi> Parliaments <hi>in the Reign of</hi> Charles the Martyr <hi>do fill in our Statute Book</hi>) He tells the Jury, <hi>That there is ſcarce in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a greater crime than this before them—It carries all the Venome and Baſeneſs, the greateſt Inveteracy againſt the</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that ever any Caſe did—That the</hi> Earl of Eſſex, <hi>rather than he would abide his</hi> Tryal, <hi>he being conſcious, the great Guilt he had contracted, made him deſtroy himſelf, immediately after my</hi> Lord Ruſſell
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35279:24"/>(<hi>one of the</hi> Conſpirators) <hi>was carried to</hi> Tryal; <hi>and it cannot be thought, but it was to prevent the methods of</hi> Juſtice, <hi>in his own Caſe: there was</hi> digitus dei <hi>in it, and 'tis enough to ſati fie all the World of the</hi> Conſpiracy — <hi>'Tis beyond all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture true, that my</hi> Lord of Eſſex <hi>did</hi> minder <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Jury</hi> by their Verdict, brought in Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> Guilty of the whole matter charged upon him in the <hi>Information;</hi> and Mr <hi>Speke</hi> Guilty of all, but <hi>conſpiring</hi> to procure falſe <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court adjudged Mr <hi>Braddon</hi> to pay 2000 <hi>
                  <hi>l.</hi> Fine;</hi> to find <hi>Sureties for good behaviour for Life,</hi> and to be committed till performed. <hi>Mr Speke,</hi> to pay 1000 <hi>

               <p>My Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> (they ſay) called for a Pen-Knife to pare his Nails, which Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife not being ready, he required a Razour, which was accordingly delivered him, with which his Lordſhip having pared his Nails, he retired into his Cloſet, and looks himſelf in, and there he cut his Throat; and the Razour (before delivered to pare his Nails) lying by the Body.</p>
               <p>But that this Relation is forged, and that there was, <hi>Firſt,</hi> No Razour delivered to my Lord to pare his Nails, nor had his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pared his Nails with any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither the Body locked into the Cloſet: Nor</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Razour lying locked in by the Body, when my Lord was firſt known to be dead, is evident from what follows, which clearly detects this Forgery. For the firſt of theſe, that there was no Razour delivered to my Lord.</p>
               <p>This appears by the Contradictions of <hi>Bomeney, Ruſſel</hi> and <hi>Monday,</hi> as to the time of the delivering this Razour, for <hi>Bomeney</hi> firſt ſwears, he delivered this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour to my Lord to pare his Nails on <hi>Friday</hi> Morning at eight of the Clock; &amp; within two
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35279:26"/>hours, poſitively ſwears in the depoſition him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf writ, that he delivered it on <hi>Thurſday</hi> morning at eight of the Clock (being the day before his death) and this as to the <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> he ſwears poſitively and circumſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, poſitively, for he doth expreſly name <hi>Thurſday,</hi> as the day on which the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour was delivered; and circumſtantially, for he doth ſwear the Razour was delivered the very next morning after my Lord came to Captain <hi>Hawley's;</hi> and his Lordſhip went to <hi>Hawley</hi>'s, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 11th of <hi>July.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſſell</hi> ſwears a point blank contradiction to <hi>Bomeney</hi>'s Oath; for <hi>Ruſſell</hi> depoſeth, and now declares, that on <hi>Friday</hi> morning, in leſs then half an hour before they found my Lord dead in his Cloſet, he ſtood as Warder at my Lord's Chamber-Door, (<hi>Monday</hi> that morning having firſt ſtood as Warder on my Lord, and was then gone down to ſtand below Stairs) and heard my Lord ask <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meney</hi> for a Pen-Knife to pare his Nails; which being not ready, his Lordſhip required a Razour; which he did immediately ſee <hi>Bomeney</hi> deliver his Lordſhip. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> doth as directly give the Lye to <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> as <hi>Ruſſell</hi> did to <hi>Bomeney,</hi> for <hi>Monday,</hi> the day my Lord died, declared,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35279:27"/>he ſaw my Lord have a Razour in his Hand, paring his Nails with it, at ſeven a Clock that morning my Lord died, and this about two hours before <hi>Ruſſell</hi> came up, to ſtand as Warder at my Lord's Chamber-door.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, unleſs it can be reconciled how this Razour ſhould be delivered a <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> Morning at eight of the Clock, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Bomeneys</hi> Oath; and yet not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered till <hi>Friday</hi> Morning at nine of the Clock, within half an hour of the time his Lordſhip was found dead, and delivered whilſt <hi>Ruſſell</hi> ſtood Warder at the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, as <hi>Ruſſell</hi> depoſeth; And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, my Lord to have had the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour, and pared his Nails with it two hours before <hi>Ruſſell</hi> came up Stairs to ſtand War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at my Lord's Chamber, as <hi>Monday</hi> declared the very day my Lord died. I ſay unleſs theſe Contradictions can be reconciled, it can't be thought that any Razour at all was delivered; And then whereas all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared my Lord pared his Nails with the Razour; by ſtrict obſervation, it appeared my Lord's Nails were not newly, before his Death, either pared or ſcraped.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> That the Cloſet-door was not lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my Lord's body, appears by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions of theſe three, as to the opening the Cloſe-door.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35279:27"/>
                  <hi>Bomeney</hi> firſt ſwore, he did open the Door (when my Lord would not anſwer upon his knocking at the Door) and there ſaw my Lord lying dead in his Blood, and the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour by him, and he then called the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but immediately ſwears in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his firſt Oath, that he peeped through a chink of the Door, and ſaw Blood and part of the Razour, and then without opening the Door, ran and called <hi>Ruſſell,</hi> who thereupon firſt opened the Door, and at Mr <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Tryal, ſwears he knew not who opened the Door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſſell</hi> depoſeth he did firſt open the Door, and makes no difficulty in it; Then comes <hi>Monday,</hi> and gives the Lye to both: For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> (the very day my Lord died) declared (what he hath ſince often confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that neither <hi>Bomeney</hi> nor <hi>Ruſſell</hi> could ſtir the Door, my Lord's Body lay ſo cloſe and hard againſt it, and he being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then either, put his Shoulders againſt the Door, and preſſing with all his might broke it open.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever there is that can reconcile theſe Contradictions (in theſe three mens Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) and make all appear credible.</p>
               <p>— <hi>Erit mihi magnus Appollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A further Argument, that the Cloſet-Door
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35279:28"/>was not locked upon the Body, appears by my Lord's Legs lying upon the Threeſhold of the Cloſet-door, when the Body was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to have been ſtirred from its firſt poſture.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> That there was no Razour lying locked in with the Body, when the Body was firſt found, appears by the bloody Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour's being thrown out of my Lord's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Window, (which is about ſeventeen Foot diſtant from the Cloſet-Door, where the Body lay) and no noiſe of my Lords death, till after the Maid carried up the Razour; which Maid thereupon firſt diſcovered my Lord's death.</p>
               <p>And, as yet other Argument, of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of theſe perfidious Villains, add the Mathematical impoſſibility of the Wound, ſeeing not above two Inches of the Razour muſt be without my Lord's hand, (had he done it himſelf) and yet the Wound above three Inches deep. Moreover, by many eminent Doctors and Chyrurgions; the Wound is thought to be naturally impoſſible to have been done by my Lord himſelf, becauſe upon cutting the firſt Jugular Artery, ſuch an effuſion of Blood and Spirit would have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thereupon followed, that Nature would not have been ſtrong enough for to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35279:28"/>cut through the other Jugular Artery, to the Neck-Bone on the other ſide, muchleſs, to make ſo many, and ſo large Notches, in the Razour againſt the Neck-Bone, as an old fooliſh or K—Chyrurgion ſuggeſted to the Coroner's Jury.</p>
               <p>VVherefore, by what is before obſerved, as to the many Contradictions, it plainly appears, that theſe three (as it is ſaid in the Hiſtory of <hi>Suſanna, verſ. 6.</hi>) are convicted of falſe Relations by their own mouths; and thoſe other Arguments before obſerved, are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Detections of theſe three mens Perjuries. It then remains as at firſt <hi>(viz.)</hi> That here is a Body found dead by violent Hands, and the manner of the Death not diſcovered (for it can't be according to theſe three mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, for the Reaſons before obſerved) The concluſion that the Law makes in ſuch caſes; in this, therefore holds good, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that this honourable Lord was Murthered by the violent and cruel Hands of barbarous and bloody minded men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the proof of the Murder; in this I ſhall firſt conſider, what is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial which paſſed before my Lords death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Day of his Death. And then</p>

Some few days after ſome of the aforeſaid Perſons declared, it was reſolved the <hi>Earl</hi>'s Throat ſhould be cut, but they would give it out that he had done it himſelf, and if any ſhould deny it, they would take them, and puniſh them for it.</p>

               <head>Secondly, For the previous Reports be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lords death.</head>
               <p>Its proved, by eight ſeveral Witneſſes, that before my Lords death (or before it could be known) it was reported, that the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat in the Tower, amongſt the reſt, it was at <hi>Frome,</hi> which is about one Hundred Miles from <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning; and at the ſame time at <hi>Andover,</hi> about ſixty Miles from <hi>London,</hi> though at neither of theſe places, eſpecially the former, could it then be known the Earl was a Priſoner in the Tower, his Lordſhip being not committed to the Tower, till the <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the Afternoon. All theſe Reports agreed in the manner how <hi>(viz.)</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Throat, and the place where <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Tower; and (which is further) at <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dover</hi> the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morning before my Lords death, it was reported not only in the manner how, and place where, but likewiſe the pretended Reaſon wherefore, was given, for it was then, and there ſaid, that the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> being a Priſoner in the Tower, and underſtanding that the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> were come into the Tower, his Lordſhip was afraid the King would have come up into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and ſeen him; of which his Lordſhips guilt and ſhame would not bear the Thought,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35279:30"/>and therefore he did cut his Throat to avoid it. This being declared two days before my Lords death, when it could not have been in the leaſt fore-thought, that the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi> would have come together into the Tower, where they had not been above twice together ſince the Reſtoration; I ſay, this previous Report, which ſo particularly cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this action, with the how, where, and wherefore; clearly proves, That all things were ſo reſolved upon to be done; or otherwiſe it is impoſſible it ſhould have been reported under theſe three eſſential Qualifications, as to manner, place, and reaſon, before it was indeed done; eſpecially at <hi>Andover,</hi> where it could not then be ſuppoſed to be known that my Lord was ſo much as a Priſoner in the Tower; this Reaſon the <hi>Papiſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves gave out juſt after my Lords Death.</p>

For the Soldier then declared, that a little before the <hi>Earl's</hi> Murder, his <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> parted a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way from his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and then two Men were ſent into the <hi>Earl's</hi> Lodgings, to Murder my <hi>Lord,</hi> which when they had done, they did again return to his <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr E</hi>— declares, That he ſaw his <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35279:31"/>Highneſs</hi> juſt before the <hi>Earl's</hi> Death, part a little from his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and then beckned to two <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to come to him, who came accordingly, his <hi>Highneſs</hi> thereupon ſent them towards the <hi>Earl of Eſſex's</hi> Lodgings, and about a quarter of an hour after, this <hi>Informant</hi> ſaw theſe very two Men return to his <hi>Highneſs,</hi> and as they came, they ſmiled, and to the beſt of this <hi>Informants</hi> hearing and remembrance, ſaid, <hi>the Buſineſs was done;</hi> upon which his <hi>Highneſs</hi> ſeemed very well pleaſed, and then went to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to whom the News was immediately brought, that the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Eſſex</hi> had cut his Throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lloyd</hi> the <hi>Centinel</hi> at my <hi>Lords</hi> door, the day my <hi>Lord</hi> died (till the twenty firſt of <hi>January</hi> laſt) did deny the letting in of any men, (and <hi>Ruſſell</hi> and <hi>Monday</hi> ſtill deny it) but now <hi>Lloyd</hi> doth confeſs that juſt before my <hi>Lords</hi> Death, two or three men, by <hi>Major Hawley's</hi> ſpecial <hi>Order,</hi> were let in, and immediately he heard them, (as he did ſuppoſe they were) go up Stairs into my <hi>Lord's</hi> Room, where there was a very great buſtle and ſtir, ſo great, that the <hi>Centinel</hi> declared, he would have forced af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, had not the firſt door been made faſt; upon the busſle he heard ſome-what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35279:31"/>thrown down like the fall of a man, which he did ſuppoſe was my <hi>Lords</hi> Body; ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, it was cryed out, my <hi>Lord of Eſſex</hi> hath cut his own <hi>Throat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is not only theſe mens going in, but a great buſtle confeſſed immediately thereupon, to enſue in my <hi>Lords</hi> Room, and the Body of a man in this buſtle to be thrown down; this is in a cloſe Priſoners Room, where no one is admitted, but his Servant, and thoſe that kept the door, denyed upon Oath, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were in my <hi>Lords</hi> Chamber that morning my <hi>Lord</hi> dyed, before his Death. But theſe <hi>Warders,</hi> being ſuppoſed privy to the Fact, would not own the admitting of thoſe men, which themſelves let in with ſuch a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therous deſign; and it is to be preſumed that this <hi>Centinel</hi> was not a ſtranger to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but enjoyned to ſecrecy; for otherwiſe he would never have declared to a Friend, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a repeated requeſt of ſecrecy, that this Confeſſion (as before) laid upon his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and troubled him night and day, for tho' it was indeed very true, that he did let in theſe men, it was what he ſhould not have confeſſed. This Conſirmation to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance (under a great and repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſecrecy) argues firſt, that this Confeſſion was indeed true.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:35279:32"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there is ſome curſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy (its probable by Oath) entred into to ſtifle this Murther, for what other proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon can be aſſigned for that trouble of Conſcience in this Confeſſion, ſeeing himſelf at the ſame time declared it was true, tho' he ſhould not have ſaid it? There are ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments that this <hi>Centinel</hi> was <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeps Criminis</hi> in the Privity; firſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in part of what he did confeſs; for, upon his being firſt apprehended, he owned the throwing out of the <hi>Razour,</hi> before my <hi>Lords</hi> Death was known, but now he retracts and diſowns it; Another inſtance of his privity, is his now prevaricating, in his now pretending, that theſe men were let in an hour, or more before my <hi>Lords</hi> Death; whereas at firſt he declared they were let in before my <hi>Lords</hi> Death; for, as ſoon as let in, he heard ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral go up Stairs into my <hi>Lords</hi> Room, and heard the busſle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before.</p>
               <p>A third argument of this <hi>Centinels</hi> privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is his not declaring the whole truth, which he muſt know; for one at a greater diſtance that ſaw theſe <hi>Ruffians,</hi> as they were buſtling with the my <hi>Lord,</hi> and heard the buſtle, did likewiſe hear one of theſe in the buſtle (as it ſeemed to be, (and therefore preſumed to be my <hi>Lord,</hi> cry out very loud, and very dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35279:32"/>
                  <hi>Murther, Murther, Murther;</hi> The <hi>Centinel</hi> who could hear the trampling, or indeed the very walking in my <hi>Lords</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, could not but hear this <hi>Murther,</hi> ſo loud and often repeated: It appears by five Cuts in my <hi>Lords</hi> right hand, <hi>(viz.)</hi> two upon his fore-finger, one upon the fourth-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, another on the little-finger, and the fifth about two Inches long in the palm of his right hand, that his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> in this buſtle made great reſiſtance; for theſe Cuts can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be done no otherwiſe, then by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to put off the cruel Inſtrument of his Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next thing that I ſhould obſerve, which happened the day my</hi> Lord <hi>dyed, and gives us reaſon to believe the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the Irregularity committed upon the Body before the</hi> Jury <hi>ſaw it, the Body was ſtrip'd and waſhed, and the Room and Cloſet waſhed, and my</hi> Lords <hi>Cloathes carried away (tho' all Men know the Body ſhould have remained in its firſt poſture, till the</hi> Coroners Jury <hi>had ſeen it.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sr T. R.</hi> as himſelf ſaith, declared to the <hi>Lords,</hi> that the Body was not ſtirred from its firſt poſture, till the next morning
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35279:33"/>about ten of the Clock. To this <hi>Sr. Tho.</hi> has not ſworn (for he was not ſworn before the <hi>Lords</hi>) and 'tis well he has not, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is ſo much miſtaken, that the contrary can be proved by almoſt twenty Witneſſes, had the Body remained in its firſt poſture, by my <hi>Lords</hi> Cravat being cut in three parts, the <hi>Jury</hi> would have plainly ſeen, that his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> could not ſo do it, with a <hi>Razour;</hi> And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> they would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the print of a bloody Foot upon my <hi>Lord</hi> as he lay in the Cloſet, by which it appeared ſome one had been with the Body in the Cloſet, and ſeveral other material circumſtances might have been diſcovered, which by the total (illegal) alteration of the Circumſtances of the Body <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
               <p>About three of the Clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon that day my <hi>Lord</hi> dyed, ſome of thoſe bloody men (who had been at the Conſult) met at <hi>Holme's</hi> Houſe, and one of them leapt about the Room as overjoyed, and as the Maſter of the Houſe came into the Room, he ſtrikes him upon the back, and cryed, <hi>The Feate was done,</hi> or <hi>We have done the Feate;</hi> upon which the Maſter ſaid, <hi>Is the Earls Throat cut?</hi> To which the other replyed, <hi>Yes;</hi> And further ſaid,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35279:33"/>
                  <hi>He could not but Laugh to think, how like a Fool the</hi> Earl of Eſſex <hi>looked, when they came to cut his Throat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To deſtroy the Teſtimony of this <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Smyth, Holms</hi> hath produced two Witneſſes who (by many Witneſſes) appear to be for-ſworn in every part of their Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.

               <head>Thirdly and laſtly, What paſſed after the day of my <hi>Lords</hi> Death.</head>
               <p>That very morning, ſeveral <hi>Soldiers</hi> (which were preſumed able to diſcover what was material, with relation to his Death) were called together (As <hi>Meakes</hi> then ſaid) and enjoyned to ſecrecy, under very ſevere Penalties.</p>
               <p>About ten of the Clock in the morning, the next day, the <hi>Jury</hi> met, and were ſurprized to ſee all the Ciroumſtances of my Lords body changed from what was firſt diſcovered.</p>
               <p>After the Jury had ſeen the naked Body at <hi>Hawley's,</hi> the <hi>Coroner</hi> adjourned them to a Victualling: Houſe in the Tower; one of the Jury demanded a ſight of the Cloaths, but the <hi>Coroner</hi> was immediately called into the next Room, from which returning to the <hi>Jury</hi> in ſome Heat, he told them, It was the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35279:34"/>Body, and not the Cloathes they were to ſit upon, the Body was there, and that was ſufficient.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury then ſaid, <hi>My Lord of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was eſteemed a very ſober, ſedate, and good Man</hi> (which <hi>Bomeney</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, ſaying, His Lord was a very pious Man) <hi>and therefore it was improbable ſo good a man ſhould be guilty of the worſt of Actions.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which <hi>Hawley</hi> told the Jury, They were miſ-informed in my Lords Character, for every man that was well acquainted with my Lord, well knew that it had ever been a fixed Principle in him, that any man might cut his Throat, or any otherwiſe diſpoſe of his Life, to avoid a diſho, nourable and infamous Death; wherefore this Action, which they thought unlike him, was according to his avowed and fixed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. This made the <hi>Jury</hi> the more eaſily believe that my Lord had indeed done it.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>Jury</hi> were for adjourning their Inquiſition to ſome further day, and in the mean time to fend notice to the <hi>Earls</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ſo that if any thing appeared on my <hi>Lords</hi> behalf, it might be produced. <hi>Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> hereupon aſſured the <hi>Jury,</hi> that they could not adjourn their enquiry, for his Majeſty had ſent one for their Inquiſition, and would
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35279:34"/>not riſe from the Coun. till it was brought him; This the Jury believing, <hi>immediately</hi> made all haſte poſſible, whereas otherwiſe they might have been more ſtrict, and particular in their <hi>Examinations; Hawley</hi> in anſwer to this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally denyes all, and proteſts that he was not nigh the <hi>Jury</hi> in the Victualing-Houſe all the time the <hi>Jury</hi> ſat, tho' moſt of the <hi>Jury</hi> can ſay the contrary. And as for the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting <hi>Self-Murder</hi> to be my <hi>Lords</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he did proteſt he did never hear it ſaid, till their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> in this <hi>Committee</hi> told him it had been ſo declared. This clearly proves that the pretended Principle of <hi>Self-Murder,</hi> was a forgery of that bloody Party which Murthered my <hi>Lord,</hi> And <hi>Hawley</hi> pitched upon as the moſt proper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to corrupt the <hi>Jury</hi> with the belief of it.</p>
               <p>The backwardneſs of the then <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to examine this matter, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt proceedings againſt the Proſecution (for they diſcouraged and ruined him who did humbly offer the matter to a judicial conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, tho' no crime or colour of offence was proved againſt him) is further evidence of this <hi>Murther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Government</hi> turned old <hi>Edward's</hi> out of his Place for what his Son ſaid in this matter, and hereby inverted the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35279:35"/>
                  <hi>For here the Sons eating ſour Grapes, had ſet the Fathers teeth an edge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A poor Soldier was barbarouſly Whipt (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been cruelly managed in Priſon) for only ſaying, That he would not ſay, that he believed the <hi>Earl of Eſſex</hi> cut his own Throat. But a more barbarous Cruelty is juſtly ſuſpected to have been committed in the after Murther of ſeveral <hi>(viz.)</hi> of <hi>Meake</hi> and <hi>Hawley,</hi> &amp;c. to prevent a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Murther.</p>
               <p>Tho' the <hi>Government</hi> heretofore had received private Intimations, and in Print publick Applications for a Pardon, and thereupon a promiſe of a full Diſcovery, and in both theſe the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> particularly charged as the chief Contriver of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Cruclty, yet the then <hi>Government</hi> would never permit ſuch an Inquiſition to be made, but puniſhed thoſe that diſperſed thoſe publick Challenges; Had his <hi>Highneſs</hi> been really Innocent, none would have been more zealous for ſuch a <hi>Proclamation</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for Innocence deſires a Tryal, and its only Guilt that flies from Juſtice. Another Argument of this <hi>Murther,</hi> and likewiſe of <hi>Major Webſter's</hi> Guilt therein, is <hi>Web<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's</hi> producing my <hi>Lords</hi> Pocket-handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35279:35"/>all bloody to ſome of his Neighbours, rejoycing at the blood of a <hi>Traytor,</hi> and the very next day to ſome of the ſame Perſon, he produced part of the price of Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> a Purſe of Gold, wherein there were Forty nine Guineas, and a Piſtol which he ſhewed in great Oſtentation, but all this was but a ſmall part of that villanous Reward, for ſometime after my <hi>Lords</hi> Death, when his Wife was upbraided with her Husbands Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, ſhe replyed, her Husband long ſince was not ſo Poor, for he had Five hundred Guineas, at which the other being ſtariled, anſwered, moſt certainly he could not come by them honeſtly, to which it was ſaid, that he got them by his Trade, but to that it was replyed, that his Trade could hardly get Bread, therefore there muſt be ſome other way.</p>
               <p>Its very probable that <hi>Webſters</hi> Wife ſpeaking of his Trade, might intend <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in which it is ſuppoſed he has been more then once concerned, tho' the other miſ-underſtood her.</p>
               <p>That ſhe was not a ſtranger to his Guilt appears, by her often telling him (upon her hard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage) that he was a Fool, as well as a Rogue to uſe her ſo ill, he knowing it to be in her power to Hang both him and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35279:36"/>in the <hi>Tower;</hi> A like Inſtance there happened upon a Quarrel between <hi>Holmes</hi> and his VVife, ſoon after my Lords Death, ſhe thereupon told him, he was a Murthering Rogue, and he well knew, that ſhe could at any time hang him for it, to which <hi>Holmes</hi> anſwered (with his uſual ſcurrolous Language, you Bitch, you Whore, you of all the World have no reaſon to ſpeak, for do not you remember I bought you a good Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Gown and Petticoat, whereupon the wife replyed, you are a Murthering Rogue for all that.</p>

            <p>IT may not be forgotten, that the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> in 1678, was to have been uſhered into the World, by a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian,</hi> or <hi>Fanatick Conſpiracy;</hi> to that end, in <hi>July</hi> 1678, when the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had reſolved to diſpatch <hi>King Charles,</hi> to

               <hi>Everard</hi> planted <hi>Sr William Waller,</hi> and <hi>Smyth</hi> (known by the Name of <hi>Narrative Smyth</hi>) within hearing; They then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting their <hi>Libel,</hi> and each of them taking a Copy of it, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> runs with great joy with it, to <hi>Nell Wall,</hi> to <hi>White-hall,</hi> but the <hi>King</hi> being unluckily at <hi>Windſor,</hi> he fatally miſſed the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of being before-hand with <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard;</hi> and was ſeized in his Bed by <hi>Sr William Waller,</hi> and carried to <hi>Secretary Jenkins;</hi> and being the next day brought before the <hi>Council,</hi> the Witneſſes were examined, and he was committed to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> for <hi>high Treaſon;</hi> Notwithſtanding a <hi>great Man</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was his Friend, and that <hi>Waller</hi> was a <hi>Rogue, and had ſpoiled all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> being faſt, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no doubt, upon <hi>Colman</hi>'s fate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to relent, and offers to make full diſcovery of the <hi>Villany,</hi> and of thoſe who omployed him in it; Thereupon, Sr <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> and <hi>Sr George Treby</hi> (as <hi>Juſtices</hi> of <hi>London</hi>) took his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; This gave great offence at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall;</hi> inſomuch, <hi>that he who had the Power of</hi> Life <hi>and</hi> Death, <hi>poſitively declared that he ſhould dye;</hi> and to prevent his further
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35279:38"/>diſcovery, which he had promiſed to make, he is inſtantly removed, and kept moſt cloſely in the <hi>Tower,</hi> where he was moſt rigorouſly handled, to make him retract his <hi>Confeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> being thus defeated, of this hopeful <hi>Fanatick Plot,</hi> calculated for the entertainment of the <hi>Oxford Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> and well knowing that <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> could make it out, who ſet them to work; <hi>and that he was paid</hi> 250 <hi>l. at</hi> White-hall <hi>for this Service;</hi> They came to a reſolution, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> muſt not pry into this miſtery of <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> however,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> being met, the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> fell upon it, and on <hi>Friday</hi> the 25th of <hi>March,</hi> 1681. Upon the reading <hi>Sr Robert Clayton</hi>'s and <hi>Sr George Treby</hi>'s Examination of <hi>Fitz-Harris; Sr John Hotham</hi> moved, that it might be printed, to ſhow the World the deviliſh <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſeconded by <hi>Sr William Jones,</hi> who ſaid, that People had been prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to believe, the <hi>Plot</hi> not true, and <hi>that that Examination confirmed the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Otes</hi> and <hi>Bedloe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Francis Winnington</hi> added, that the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35279:39"/>Treaſonable Paper of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> was to have been ſent to many <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and they to have been ſeized thereupon, as Traytors in a Conſpiracy againſt the King; That all was at ſtake, therefore let not our Courage leſſen; Let us go to the bottom of this buſineſs of <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> I move, he may be impeached of <hi>High-Treaſon;</hi> and it may be he will relent and tell you all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Robert Clayton</hi> then ſaid, That, when <hi>F. Harris</hi> his Examination was taken at <hi>Newgate,</hi> he told him, that he thought he had not dealt ingenuouſly, unleſs he would tell what Council he had for drawing the Paper; and that he had him be ingenuous in the whole matter, and he would come and take his further Examination; and that <hi>F. Harris</hi> having promiſed this; he was removed out of their reach into the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherepon, an <hi>Impeachment</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; &amp; Sr <hi>L. Jenkins</hi> commanded to carry it to the <hi>Lords;</hi> and <hi>Col. Birch</hi> ſaid, That we ought all to give <hi>God</hi> thanks for this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> next to the firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Plot.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 26th of <hi>March,</hi> 1681, the Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the Houſe of <hi>Lords</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35279:39"/>to proceed upon the <hi>Impeachment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Thomas Lee</hi> ſaid, That he ſaw, by the <hi>Lords</hi> refuſing the <hi>Impeachment,</hi> no further uſe of <hi>Parliaments, That they would be a Court, or not a Court, to ſerve a preſent purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Sr William Jones</hi> ſpoke to this effect; Indictments were brought againſt the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and yet that was no impediment to their <hi>Impeachment</hi> in the <hi>Lords Houſe;</hi> but, here is no Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Proſecution brought againſt <hi>Fitz-Harris.</hi> We have an inſtance freſh in memory, <hi>Scroggs</hi> a <hi>Commoner,</hi> and not indicted at Common-Law, yet the <hi>Lords</hi> without ſcruple accepted his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment;</hi> We find the <hi>Lords</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined a great point, <hi>The Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> as well as Temporal, <hi>have voted the refuſal of the Impeachment of</hi> Fitz-Harris, which we own not in this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, nor I hope never ſhall; and, <hi>We are denyed Juſtice by the</hi> Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, <hi>who have no right to Vote;</hi> This is a double act of Injuſtice; Let us then Vote. <hi>That the Commons have a Right to impeach in capital Caſes; and that the Lords have denyed us Juſtice in refuſing the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> way; At a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35279:40"/>ſhow how unwarrantable the <hi>Lords</hi> Actions have been, and if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the <hi>Parl.</hi> follows, <hi>its the fault of thoſe Men who will not hear our Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Francis Winnington</hi> backt this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſaid; This <hi>Impeachment</hi> is not an ordinary Accuſation, but it <hi>relates to our</hi> Religion, and Property <hi>and how the</hi> Biſhops <hi>come to ſtifle this, let</hi> God <hi>and the World judge</hi>—If the <hi>Lords</hi> will vote, that the <hi>Commons</hi> ſhall not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach him; They may as well vote, they ſhall not be <hi>Proſecutors.</hi> This is a <hi>new Plot</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> of which <hi>F. Harris</hi> is accuſed; and <hi>We muſt not Impeach him;</hi> In this, the <hi>Lords</hi> ſay, we muſt not hear it; — I deſire you would come to ſome <hi>Vote,</hi> you are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſcover the <hi>Plot,</hi> if you could; — If our time be ſhort (as I believe it is) pray come to ſome Reſolution to aſſert your Right;—A little while ago, when the <hi>Duke</hi> was preſented for <hi>a Papiſt,</hi> the <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> was diſmiſſed by the <hi>Chief Juſtice;</hi> This ſeems, as if the <hi>Lords</hi> would juſtifie the <hi>Judges Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,</hi> by their own;—If no Man doubts our Right, pray vote it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Robert Howard</hi> then ſpoke to this effect, This of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> ſeems to me,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35279:40"/>to be a more dangerous breath then uſual, a breath fit to be ſtifled; <hi>There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this more then ordinary.</hi> If there be ſo ſacred a reſpect to common Tryals, in <hi>Inferiour Courts;</hi> 'tis ſtrange, that the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> ſhould be below a <hi>Common-Jury;</hi>—It ſeems the <hi>Lords</hi> value <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to keep him from us,—If <hi>Dangerfield</hi> would ſpeak what he knew, nothing of Mercy was too big for him; but they hurry <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> away to the <hi>Tower,</hi> when he began to confeſs in <hi>Newgate; Are you ſo loſt, that you have no Mercy left for the</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion—We hear that the <hi>French Ambaſſador</hi> had a hand in this <hi>Plot,</hi> which a Jury will not enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. I muſt confeſs, that by the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of this, I have enlarged my ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for I cannot but ſuſpect unuſual ways—Something depends upon this Man—Sure We muſt not lay down all Proſecution of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and ſay, that the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> ſhall have no Mercy. <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> may merit Mercy by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and if his breath be ſtoped by the <hi>Lords,</hi> I am ſorry that People will ſay, If it were not for the <hi>Lds. F. H.</hi> might have diſcovered all the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> might have been ſaved.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:35279:41"/>
            <p>Mr <hi>Serjeant Maynard</hi> then added, We all know what Arts and Crafts have been uſed, to hide the <hi>Plot;</hi> it began with <hi>Murder, Perjury</hi> and <hi>Subornation;</hi> This of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> is a ſecond part of it; The <hi>Lords</hi> deny to receive our <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment;</hi> In effect, they make this no <hi>Parliament;</hi> if We are the <hi>Proſecutors,</hi> and they will not hear our <hi>Accuſation;</hi> Tis ſtrange, when their own lives, as well as ours, are concerned in the <hi>Plot</hi>— When all is at ſtake; We muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute; If this be ſo, <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> muſt ſubmit to the <hi>French;</hi> and they run over all: This is a ſtrange breach of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and tends to the danger of the <hi>Kings Perſon,</hi> and deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Thomas Player</hi> then ſaid, This of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> is a conſiderable confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former <hi>Plot;</hi> I call it the <hi>Old Plot, but tis ſtill new upon us;</hi> when he inclined to diſcover what he knew, he was fetched to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and ſent to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and ſo We were deprived of all further hopes of diſcovery; and now they ſtop his Mouth; I move therefore, That you will declare, <hi>That if any Judge, Juſtice, or Jury, proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35279:41"/>him, and he found guilty; that you will declare them guilty of his Murder, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers of the Rights of the</hi> Commons <hi>of</hi> England; Hereupon the <hi>Houſe</hi> came to theſe <hi>Reſolves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is the undoubted right of the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>in</hi> Parliament <hi>aſſembled; to impeach, before the</hi> Lords <hi>in</hi> Parliament, <hi>any</hi> Peer, <hi>or</hi> Commoner <hi>for</hi> Treaſon, <hi>or any other Crime or Miſdemeanour; and that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of the</hi> Lords <hi>to proceed in</hi> Parliament <hi>upon ſuch</hi> Impeachment, <hi>is a denyal of</hi> Juſtice, <hi>and a violation of the Conſtitution of</hi> Parliaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in the Caſe of</hi> E. Fitz-Harris, <hi>who by the Commons, has been impeached for</hi> High Treaſon, <hi>before the</hi> Lords, <hi>with a Declaration, That in convenient time, they would bring up the Articles againſt him; For the</hi> Lords, <hi>to reſolve, that the ſaid</hi> Fitz-Harris <hi>ſhould be proceeded with, according to the courſe of the</hi> Common-Law; <hi>and not by way of Impeachment in</hi> Parliament; <hi>is a denyal of</hi> Juſtice; <hi>and a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conſtitution of</hi> Parliaments; <hi>and an Obſtruction to the further diſcovery of the</hi> Popiſh Plot; <hi>and of great danger to his</hi> Majeſties <hi>Perſon, and the</hi> Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:35279:42"/>
            <p>
               <hi>That for any</hi> Inferiour Court <hi>to proceed againſt him, or any other Perſon, lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an</hi> Impeachment <hi>in</hi> Parliament, <hi>for the ſame Crimes, for which he or they ſtand impeached, is an high breach of the</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament.</p>
            <p>This matter, thus agitated in the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> was countenanced by a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> of many <hi>Temporal Lords,</hi> which was to this effect,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in all Ages, it had been an undoubted Right of the</hi> Commons, <hi>to impeach before the</hi> Lords <hi>any Subject for</hi> Treaſons, <hi>or any other Crime whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That they could not reject ſuch</hi> Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>becauſe that</hi> Suit <hi>or</hi> Complaint, <hi>can be determined no where elſe; for an</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment <hi>is at the Suit of the</hi> People; <hi>but an</hi> Indictment <hi>is at the Suit of the</hi> King; <hi>As, the</hi> King <hi>may Indict at his Suit, for Murther, and the Heir, or the Wife of the Party Murthered may bring an</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Which was always to be preferred, and upon notice thereof, all Proſecutions at the Kings Suit were to ſtop, till the Proſecution at the Suit of the Party was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</note> Appeal; <hi>And the</hi> King <hi>cannot Releaſe that</hi> Appeal; <hi>nor his</hi> Indictment <hi>prevent the Proceedings in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is an abſolute</hi> denial of Juſtice; <hi>in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35279:42"/>regard it cannot be tryed any where elſe; The Houſe of</hi> Peers, <hi>as to</hi> Impeachments, <hi>proceed by vertue of their</hi> Judicial Power; <hi>and not by their</hi> Legiſlative; <hi>and as to that, act as a</hi> Court <hi>of</hi> Record; <hi>and can deny</hi> Suitors (<hi>eſpecially the</hi> Commons <hi>of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>that bring legal Complaint before them</hi>) <hi>no more than the</hi> Judges <hi>of</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>can deny any ſuite, regularly commenced before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Law ſaith, in the Perſon of the</hi> King, Nulli negabimus Juſtitiam, <hi>We will deny Juſtice to no ſingle Perſon; yet here, Juſtice is denyed to the whole Body of the</hi> People, <hi>This may be interpreted an exerciſe of</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary <hi>Power, and have an influence upon the Conſtitution of the</hi> Engliſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>and be an encouragement to all</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Courts, <hi>to exerciſe the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, by denying the Preſentments of</hi> Grand-Juries, <hi>&amp;c for which, at this time, the</hi> Chief Juſtice <hi>ſtands impeached in the</hi> Houſe <hi>of</hi> Peers.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice Pemberton</hi> ſaid, your ſcruple is this; here was an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> offered againſt <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to the <hi>Lords,</hi> which was not received, and thereupon there was a Vote of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> that he ſhould not be Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any other <hi>Inferiour Court;</hi> We do tell you, 'tis our Opinion, that, If an <hi>Indictment</hi> be exhibited to you, you are bound to enquire, by vertue of your Oathes; you cannot, nor ought to take notice of any ſuch <hi>Impeachment,</hi> nor <hi>Votes;</hi> and We ought to proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Juſtice, in Caſes that are brought before us: This <hi>We declare as the</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>of all the</hi> Judges of England.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Jury</hi> went away, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards found the <hi>Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> Mr <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was brought to the <hi>King's Bench-Bar,</hi> and Arraigned upon the <hi>Indictment;</hi> whereupon, he offered a <hi>Plea</hi> in writing, to the <hi>Juriſdiction of the Court;</hi> and the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, We do not receive ſuch Pleading as this, without a <hi>Counſels</hi> hand to it.</p>
            <p>Upon which, the <hi>Priſoner</hi> deſired the

            <p>Upon <hi>Monday</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the four Council moved the <hi>Court</hi> to have longer time for drawing the <hi>Plea;</hi> and that they might have a ſight of the <hi>Indictment</hi> as neceſſary to the drawing it; but they were oppoſed therein by Mr <hi>Attorney,</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> denyed both; Then Sr <hi>George Treby,</hi> and Mr <hi>Smith,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſigned as <hi>Council</hi> for the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> at his requeſt.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Attorney General</hi> then prayed <hi>Judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Plea;</hi> ſaying, 'Tis an <hi>inſufficient Plea;</hi> nay, 'tis no Plea to to bar you of your <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever will plead to the <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> if he have any <hi>Record</hi> to plead, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in <hi>Court;</hi> and for this matter, it will appear a plain <hi>frivolous Plea;</hi> for there is no ſuch matter depending as this <hi>Plea</hi> alledges; Another thing is this, They have pleaded no <hi>Record</hi> at all, nor any Impeachment at all; For they ſay he was impeached by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons de alta Proditione;</hi> but that is nought; The <hi>Plea</hi> ought to ſet forth, for what Crime particularly; this is no <hi>Plea</hi> to the <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> upon that point. —<hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> then ſaid, Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether if it be an <hi>inſufficient Plea,</hi> and ſuch that no Iſſue can be taken upon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35279:46"/>it, whether you would not demur to it; Conſider whether you think fit to <hi>demur,</hi> or to take <hi>Iſſue</hi> upon it, or reply to it; that it may come <hi>judicially</hi> for our <hi>Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>King's Council; Mr Solicitor, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Jeffryes, Sr Francis Wythens,</hi> and <hi>Mr Saunders</hi> ſpoke much to the effect with Mr <hi>Attorney,</hi> and preſſed to have the <hi>Plea rejected;</hi> but after much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſting about the matter, the <hi>Attorney</hi> agreed to <hi>demur</hi> generally, and the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's Council</hi> immediately joyned in <hi>Demurrer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Mr <hi>Attorney</hi> moved thus; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your Judgment, that the <hi>Plea</hi> may ſtand <hi>over ruled, for a plain fatal Error in is,</hi> This is a particular <hi>Indictment</hi> for the framing a moſt pernicious ſcandalous <hi>Label</hi> againſt the <hi>King;</hi> They, to out the <hi>Court</hi> of this <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> plead, that he was <hi>Impeached of high Treaſon</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; Now, <hi>Pleas to the Juriſdiction,</hi> ought to be the moſt certain of any <hi>Pleas</hi> whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> added, <hi>This Plea is neither good in matter nor forme;</hi> he that pleads an <hi>Indictment</hi> or <hi>Impeachment</hi> in another <hi>Court,</hi> muſt ſet it forth in the <hi>Plea;</hi> which is not done in this Caſe, and We
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35279:46"/>take that to be fatal to it.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Williams</hi> (for the <hi>Priſoner</hi>) then ſaid, We hope the <hi>Court</hi> in this Caſe will not tye us up preſently to argue this matter; Mr <hi>Attorney</hi> ſayes, he never found that any <hi>Plea</hi> to the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a <hi>Demurer,</hi> but was over-ruled, or allowed by the <hi>Court</hi> preſently; The <hi>Precedent</hi> in <hi>Elliot's</hi> Caſe, is full in it; He was <hi>Indicted</hi> for Miſdemeanors in the <hi>Houſe of Commons;</hi> he Pleaded this to the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Attorney</hi> at that time, inſiſted to have it rejected but the <hi>Court</hi> over-ruled him, and put him to <hi>demur; This is a Precedent</hi> Mr At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney <hi>hath not ſeen:</hi> The <hi>Court,</hi> in that Caſe, did not tye them up to argue the <hi>Plea</hi> preſently, but gave them till the next <hi>Term. Here is a Mans Life in queſtion, and the Priviledge of</hi> Parliament <hi>concerned in it; We deſire a reaſonable time;</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Plunket,</hi> you gave him till next <hi>Term;</hi> which is as high a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> as this, I am ſure of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Francis Winnington,</hi> ſpoke to the ſame purpoſe, and ſaid, <hi>This is a Caſe well worth our taking care of, and yours too;</hi> We hope you will not deny us what time is reaſonable.</p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:35279:47"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Wallop</hi> added, That he had been an unprofitable <hi>Attendant</hi> in that <hi>Court</hi> near forty Years, and <hi>never ſaw ſo ſwift a proceeding as this, which is as ſwift as lightning;</hi> That, whereas they called it a <hi>frivolous Plea;</hi> he believed the <hi>Plea</hi> to be of the greateſt import, that ever thoſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> came there about; That, <hi>de Morte Hominis, nulla eſt Cunctatio longa;</hi> That he humbly prayed a reaſonable time to be allotted.</p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the <hi>Priſoner's Counſel,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>plead over. Mr Pollexfen</hi> anſwered, We cannot do it, we have conſidered it, and are of Opinion, that if we ſhould plead over, it would deſtroy our Plea; by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, we give up the Juriſdiction. It is as indifferent to me, as any Body, to be forced to argue it now; but, No Body can ſay, they ever ſaw many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the like nature; Therefore, pray <hi>my Lord,</hi> let us not go on ſo haſtily with it; If you will not give us leave and time to be prepared to argue it, you muſt take it as we are able, ſince we can't have time to make our ſelves able.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Attorney, Solicitor General</hi> and <hi>Sr George Jeffryes,</hi> vehemently oppoſed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35279:47"/>the allowing any time, to argue the matter, and preſſed for preſent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but after much tugging about it, the <hi>Court</hi> allowed time till the <hi>Saturday</hi> following.</p>
            <p>Then, upon <hi>Saturday</hi> the 7th of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Attorney General</hi> began, ſaying, This is a Plea to the Juriſdiction of the Court, and ſome of our Exceptions are to the form, and one is to the matter. To the Form,
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1ſt,</hi> The general Allegation, that he was impeached <hi>de alta Proditione,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, it ought to have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet out, that the <hi>Court</hi> might judge, Whether it be the ſame Crime; <hi>and it is not helped by the Averrment.</hi>

                     <hi>2dly.</hi> Here is no <hi>Impeachment</hi> alledged to be upon Record; They make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Allegation, that <hi>F. Harris</hi> was Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, <hi>Impetitus fuit,</hi> by the <hi>Commons,</hi> before the <hi>Lords, Quae quidem Impetitio in pleno robore exiſtit, prout per Recordum inde, &amp;c.</hi> Now, there is no Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mentioned before; And <hi>quae quidem Impetitio,</hi> is a relative Clauſe; and no Impeachment being mentioned before in the Plea, there is nothing averred upon the Record to be continued, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35279:48"/>diſcontinued; for <hi>Impetitio,</hi> does not actively ſignifie the Impeaching, or paſſively the Perſon Impeached; but it ſignifies the Impeachment, the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is to be upon Record: Therefore, when they ſay, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, and afterwards alledge, <hi>Quae quidem Impetitio,</hi> remains upon Record; that cannot be good, for the Relative there, is only Illuſive.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the matter of the <hi>Plea;</hi> 'tis a Plea to the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Court;</hi> There the point will be, <hi>Whether a Suite depending, even in a Superior Court, can take away the Juriſdiction of an</hi> Inferiour Court, <hi>which had an</hi> Original Juriſdiction <hi>of the Cauſe, and of the Perſon, at the time of the Fact committed;</hi> I inſiſt upon theſe Exceptions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Williams</hi> (for the <hi>Priſoner</hi>) then ſaid, I take theſe things to be admitted, <hi>(Mr Attorney having demurred generally.)</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That the Priſoner ſtands Impeached.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That the Impeachment is now in being.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>That this was done,</hi> ſecundum Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem &amp; Conſuetudiem Parliamenti; <hi>and being ſo, remains in plenis ſuis robore &amp; effectu;</hi> And more particularly, the Plea, refers to the <hi>Record,</hi> for the parts and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35279:48"/>Circumſtances of the <hi>Impeachment; prout patet per Record.</hi> So that it refers the <hi>Impeachment</hi> to the <hi>Record,</hi> and tells you, 'tis amongſt the Records of that <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. Moreover, <hi>That the Treaſon in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, and the Treaſon in the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are one and the ſame; and that this Perſon</hi> Fitz-Harris <hi>indicted, and</hi> F. H. <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, are one and the ſame Perſon;</hi> And withal, it appears upon the Record, that this <hi>Impeachment</hi> was depending, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Indictment</hi> found, for the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was the 21ſt of <hi>March,</hi> and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears this is an <hi>Indictment</hi> of this <hi>Term;</hi> And further, it appears not, by any thing to the contrary in the Record, but that this <hi>Parliament</hi> is ſtill in being, and then it muſt be admitted ſo to be— Whether your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> now, will think fit in this Court, to proceed upon that <hi>Indictment,</hi> is the ſubſtance of the Caſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I think it will not be denyed, but that the <hi>Commons</hi> may Impeach any <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner,</hi> before the <hi>Lords; That was the Caſe of</hi> Treſilian <hi>and</hi> Belknap, <hi>in the time of</hi> Richard <hi>the ſecond; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon that Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one of them was</hi> Executed, <hi>and the other</hi> Baniſhed <hi>in</hi> Parliament.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Mr Attorney</hi> allows the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to be a <hi>Superior Court;</hi> but ſays, yet the <hi>Inferiour Court,</hi> having Original Juriſdiction of the Perſon and Cauſe, may proceed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an <hi>Impeachment</hi> in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> I will ſhew how manifeſtly, an <hi>Indictment</hi> and an <hi>Impeachment</hi> differ — The Caſe of an <hi>Appeal,</hi> is like the Caſe of an <hi>Impeachment: An Appeal</hi> of <hi>Murder,</hi> is at the ſuite of the <hi>Party;</hi> and in this caſe, 'tis at the ſuite of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;</hi> tis not in the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> but of all the <hi>Commons of England;</hi> So that 'tis like an <hi>Appeal,</hi> and not like an <hi>Indictment, an</hi> Indictment <hi>is for the</hi> King, <hi>an</hi> Impeachment <hi>for the</hi> People—<hi>It is not ſafe to alter the old ways of Parliament;</hi> 'tis out of the road of Compariſons, when they will compare an <hi>Indictment,</hi> and an <hi>Impeachment</hi> together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It becomes not the Juſtice of this Court, to weaken the Methods of Proceedings in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi> Your proceeding upon this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,</hi> is to ſubject the Method of their <hi>Proceedings</hi> there, to the <hi>Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of this <hi>Court</hi>—It is not fit, that the Juſtice of the Kingdom, and the <hi>High Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ſhould be crampt, by the Methods of an <hi>Inferiour Court,</hi> and a <hi>Jury.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:35279:49"/>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> is the <hi>ſupreame Court;</hi> and this Court every way inferiour to it; and 'twill be very ſtrange, that the Supreame Court ſhould be hindred here. For the higheſt Court is always ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the wiſeſt, and the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> a greater and wiſer Body, than a <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> of any one <hi>County:</hi> And the <hi>Judges</hi> in that <hi>Court</hi> (the <hi>Peers</hi>) <hi>to be the Wiſeſt</hi> Judges: <hi>Will the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> England <hi>ſuffer an Examination, Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Proſecution for Treaſon, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Hands of the greateſt and wiſeſt</hi> Inqueſt <hi>in</hi> England? <hi>And will it ſuffer the</hi> Judicature, <hi>to be taken out of the hands of the</hi> wiſeſt Judges?—It ſtands not with the Wiſdom of the <hi>Law,</hi> or of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing is this <hi>(the common Argument in an extraordinary Caſe)</hi> there is no <hi>Precedent</hi> for this way of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; 'Tis my <hi>Lord Cok's</hi> Argument <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35279:50"/>caſe, in regard it never was done from the beginning of the World till now, it being without Preſident, there is no Law for it.</p>
            <p>Another miſchief, which follows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, is; If you take this Caſe out of the power of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and bring it into this <hi>Court;</hi> where the Offence may be pardoned; you change the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of proceedings, which make the Offence, without conſent of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors,</hi> not pardonable by Law; This may be of dangerous conſequence to the Publick—by giving this <hi>Court</hi> a <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> and poſſeſſing it of theſe Cauſes, expoſe them to the will of the <hi>Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This way of proceeding, inverts the Law in another thing; 'Tis a <hi>Principle, that no man's Life is to be put twice in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for the ſame thing:</hi> If you proceed upon this Indictment, and he be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will that acquittal bind the <hi>Lords</hi> in <hi>Parliament?</hi> If they may proceed upon the <hi>Impeachment,</hi> then you invade every <hi>Engliſh-man's</hi> right, and his Life may be brought in queſtion, twice upon the ſame account.</p>
            <p>I take it to be a Critical thing, now at this time, to make ſuch attempts as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35279:50"/>theſe are; There are <hi>Lords</hi> now that lie under <hi>Impeachments</hi> of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> if you goon in this; do you not open a Gap that may be a ground to deliver them; By the ſame Juſtice, the <hi>Lords</hi> may be tryed by another Court; — This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding will have this effect; it will ſtir up a Queſtion, between the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of this <hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament;</hi> for in probability, if this Perſon be acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the <hi>Commons,</hi> and the <hi>Lords</hi> too, will look into it;— <hi>If he be found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; here is the Power of the</hi> Commons, <hi>in</hi> Impeaching; <hi>and the</hi> Juriſdiction <hi>of the</hi> Lords, <hi>in</hi> Tryal <hi>and</hi> Judgment, <hi>taken away by an</hi> Inferiour Court: This being ſaid in general, I come to the particular <hi>Exceptions</hi> made by <hi>Mr Attorney,</hi> to the form of the <hi>Plea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He inſiſts, that this <hi>Plea,</hi> doth not ſet forth any <hi>Record</hi> of an <hi>Impeachment;</hi> nor the particular matter of it; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to the Caſe of a Plea, of <hi>Auter foitz acquit;</hi> If a Man has been Indicted and Acquitted, he may plead it in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court; that hath Juriſdiction of the Cauſe, if again Indicted for the ſame matter.</p>
            <p>I ſay, I take this to be a very good
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35279:51"/>
               <hi>Plea,</hi> and that according to the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Auter foitz acquit;</hi> In pleading a General <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> We need not ſet forth the whole <hi>Act,</hi> but refer to the <hi>Record;</hi>—In the Caſe of <hi>auter foitz acquit;</hi> there is an <hi>Indictment, Proceeding</hi> of the <hi>Cour</hi> upon the <hi>Plea,</hi> a <hi>Tryal</hi> and an <hi>Acquittal,</hi> and a <hi>Record</hi> of all this matter; and if the party be again In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, he hath a Record to plead, which will ſhew the whole matter; and if he does not plead it, 'tis his own default; But in this Caſe, here is no ſuch Record to plead; and there is <hi>Mr Attorney</hi>'s miſtake; you muſt in this Caſe, be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Methods of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> which is this; the <hi>Commons</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach a Man, and bring up the <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the <hi>Lords,</hi> in general; and have Liberty to preſent <hi>Articles</hi> after due conſideration—It is ſaid in this Plea, that it is <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Parliamenti,</hi>—you are to take notice of the Law of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond Exception</hi> is, That it is not ſaid in the body of the <hi>Plea;</hi> that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> is Impeached for this <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but it comes in only in the <hi>Averment.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:35279:51"/>
            <p>As to that; we muſt purſue the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> as it is in the <hi>Lords Journal;</hi> 'tis for <hi>Treaſon</hi> generally, there; and 'tis ſaid to be, <hi>ſecundum Legem, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudinem Parliamenti;</hi> which goes to all, and there is a Record of it, among the Records of <hi>Parliament;</hi> and <hi>Mr At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi> hath confeſſed it by the <hi>demurrer;</hi> And this is the ſame Treaſon, we do aver, in fact; which alſo is confeſſed by the <hi>demurrer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Attorney</hi> hath fancied an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Grammar;</hi> an Adjective for a Subſtantive; but, I take it to be as well as any Man can plead in this caſe; The Priſoner ſays, the <hi>Commons</hi> Impeached him; which <hi>Impeachment</hi> is ſtill in force before the <hi>Lords;</hi> It is as plain as can be, if they did <hi>Impeach</hi> him, then there was an <hi>Impeachment;</hi> it can bear no other ſence.</p>
            <p>Another <hi>Exception,</hi> and which was ſtrongly urged, is, <hi>That the King may chuſe his Court;</hi> 'Tis no doubt, the <hi>King</hi> may chuſe his Court, for his own Action; but the <hi>Impeachment</hi> is the Suit of the <hi>Commons;</hi> and that is to be tryed in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and no where elſe.</p>

            <p>There was the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Caſe 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.

            <p>Then, there is the Caſe of <hi>Mr Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and others, 1ſt. and 2d. <hi>Phi.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> the <hi>Information</hi> is this; <hi>That they

               <hi>Mr Williams</hi> then concluded his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> thus; <hi>My Lord,</hi> I have done with my Reaſons for the matter and for the form; <hi>Here is the Life of a Man before you, here is the right of the Commons to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach in</hi> Parliament, <hi>before you; Here is the</hi> Judicature <hi>of the</hi> Lords <hi>to determine that</hi> Impeachment <hi>before you; Here is the Method and Proceedings of Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you;</hi> and I hope you will proceed no further on the <hi>Indictment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cheif Juſtice</hi> then ſaid, <hi>Here is nothing of the</hi> Commons <hi>Right to</hi> Impeach, <hi>before us; nor of the</hi> Lords <hi>Juriſdiction; nor the Methods of</hi> Parliament, <hi>in this Caſe;</hi> the ſole matter is, whether this be a good Plea, to ouſt the Court of its Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this matter; To which,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge Jones</hi> added, Here is nothing of any fact done in <hi>Parliament,</hi> inſiſted on here; this is for a thing done without Doors.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Mr Williams</hi> replyed, 'Tis a hard matter <hi>(my Lord)</hi> for the <hi>Bar</hi> to anſwer the <hi>Bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr Francis Winnington,</hi> then argued for the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> thus; The <hi>King's At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney</hi> has demurred generally; and if our <hi>Plea</hi> be well and formally pleaded, I am ſure, <hi>all the matter of fact is confeſſed by the</hi> demurrer. And upon the matter of fact ſo agreed, the general Queſtion is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether an Impeachment by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and ſtill depending, be ſufficient to ouſt the Court to proceed upon an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſame offence?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, That cannot come in queſtion in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Francis Winnington,</hi> replyed, Why my Lord?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> The Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have pleaded ſufficient matter to ouſt us of our Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Francis Winnington</hi> proceeded, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, My meaning is the ſame; It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that there were no doubt to be made of the Plea, if there had been a particular <hi>Impeachment—The Houſe of</hi> Lords <hi>is a Superiour Court to this, and a Suit in a Superiour Court, may be pleaded
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35279:54"/>to ſtop the Proceedings of an Inferiour Court; and if once the Suit be well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in the Superiour Court, it cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter go down to the Inferiour;</hi> and what is begun in one <hi>Parliament,</hi> may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in another; So is the Caſe 4. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. N. 16. of the <hi>Lord Berkley,</hi> and thoſe accuſed of the death of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. It was there objected, as 'tis here, that by this means there might be a ſtop of Juſtice, by the diſſolution of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet the true anſwer is, That it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in Law, that <hi>Parliaments</hi> will be called frequently, according to the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.14. 36 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Record is well pleaded, and could not be otherwiſe,</hi> unleſs Mr <hi>Attorney</hi> would have us plead what is falſe; the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Impeached <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> generally, and We alledge in our Plea, that 'twas, <hi>ſecundum legem &amp; conſuetudinem Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> and ſo 'tis confeſſed by the <hi>Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A general <hi>Impeachment,</hi> is good by the Law and courſe of <hi>Parliament; Coke</hi> 4 Inſt. 14, 15 ſays, <hi>What the Law and courſe of Parliament is, the Judges will never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with.</hi> We find 11 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Rot Parl,</hi> part 2. and <hi>Ruſhworth,</hi> part 1. in the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:35279:55"/>51. <hi>Treſilian</hi> and others, <hi>were appealed againſt for Treaſon,</hi> the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Civil Law,</hi> were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>King,</hi> to adviſe of the matter; they all agreed, that the Proceedings were neither agreeable to Common, or Civil Law; <hi>But, the</hi> Lords <hi>ſaid, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not to thoſe</hi> Judges <hi>to guide them; but they were to proceed according to the</hi> Courſe <hi>and</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Parliaments; <hi>and no Opinion of theirs, ſhould ouſt them of their Juriſdiction.</hi>

            <p>31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Rot. Parl.</hi> N. 26. The <hi>Judges</hi> were demanded, whether the <hi>Speaker</hi> of the <hi>Commons;</hi> during an Adjournment, might be Arreſted; They excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, <hi>That in this great matter, they ought not to interpoſe, it being a matter of</hi> Parliament.</p>
            <p>In the great <hi>Council 1ſt.</hi> and <hi>2d. Jac.</hi> The <hi>Judges refuſed to give their Opinions,</hi> upon queſtions put to them, about the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of both <hi>Kingdoms; for that ſuch things did not belong to them, but were matters fit for Parliament only;</hi> Hence I infer, that ſince 'tis Pleaded here to be according to Law of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and Mr <hi>Attorney</hi> hath acknowledged it; that <hi>you are fore-cloſed from meddling further with this Caſe; it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35279:55"/>being a matter whereof you cannot judge.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>'Tis objected, That, <hi>if the</hi> Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>be admitted to be according to the courſe of</hi> Parliament; <hi>yet, 'tis ſo general the</hi> Court <hi>cannot judge upon it.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> would not Impeach a Man for no Crime; <hi>The</hi> Priſoner's <hi>Plea avers, that that it was for the ſame Treaſon in the</hi> Indictment; this makes the matter as clear to the <hi>Court;</hi> as if the <hi>Impeachment</hi> had mentioned the particular <hi>Treaſon.</hi>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35279:57"/>the nature of the thing will bear; and they are not confined to the ſtrict Rules of other Courts; The <hi>Earl of Clarendon</hi> was Impeached generally, and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> took time to bring in their Articles. I have had the Experience in three or four <hi>Parliaments, (wherein We have been buſied with Impeachments, tho' We have had no great ſucceſs in them)</hi> That, tho' the <hi>Commons</hi> may carry up particular <hi>Articles</hi> at firſt, yet the Courſe is, for the <hi>Lords</hi> to receive the <hi>general Impeachment;</hi> and the <hi>Commons</hi> ſay, that in due time, They will bring in their <hi>Articles;</hi> So it was done in the Caſe of the five <hi>Popiſh Lords;</hi> and in that Caſe, tho' the <hi>Parliament</hi> was Diſſolved before any Articles ſent up; yet, in the next <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Articles,</hi> upon the former <hi>Impeachments,</hi> were ſent up and received; yet, <hi>Indictments</hi> were againſt them, before any <hi>Impeachment,</hi> and preparations made for their <hi>Tryals;</hi> but there hath been no attempt to try them upon the <hi>Indictments,</hi> tho' there have been ſeveral Intervals of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Caſe, is ſtronger than that of the <hi>Lords;</hi> for in this, the firſt Suit was in the Houſe of <hi>Lords;</hi> but in the other Caſe, the firſt was the Suit of the <hi>King,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:35279:57"/>by <hi>Indictment;</hi> and yet, by a ſubſequent <hi>Impeachment,</hi> that was ſtop'd, and the <hi>Lords</hi> are yet <hi>Priſoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the</hi> Objection, <hi>That the</hi> King <hi>may chuſe in what Court he will ſue; It is agreed, when it is at his own Suit; but this is not ſo, but at the</hi> Commons <hi>Suit, and can be no where elſe proſecuted but where it depends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, This <hi>Plea</hi> cannot be <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled,</hi> without deciding, <hi>whether the</hi> Lords <hi>can proceed upon ſuch</hi> general Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>and whether the</hi> Commons <hi>can Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach in ſuch a general way; This Caſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns the</hi> Juriſdiction <hi>of the</hi> Lords; <hi>the</hi> Priviledges <hi>of the</hi> Commons, <hi>and the Rights of all the</hi> People <hi>of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Wallop (for the Priſoner)</hi> then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued thus; There are in this <hi>Plea,</hi> three principal parts, upon which it turns, which are expreſly alledged, <hi>1ſt, That the Priſoner, before the Indictment, was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> Law <hi>and</hi> Cuſtom <hi>of</hi> Parliament <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached. 2d, That the</hi> Impeachment <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains inforce.</hi> The <hi>3d,</hi> great Point and Hinge upon which it turns, is this, <hi>That the Treaſon in the Indictment, and the Treaſon for which he was Impeached, is one and the ſame Treaſon;</hi> Theſe three things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35279:58"/>by Mr <hi>Attorney,</hi> for all things well alledged and pleaded, are confeſſed by the <hi>demurrer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I paſs the two former points; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no difficulty in them; I take the third to be the only point in the Caſe; and if We have well averred it, and can by Law be let into ſuch an <hi>Averment; I hope this</hi> Court <hi>will not pretend to go on in this Caſe;</hi> They object; becauſe he is <hi>Impeached</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that cannot be averred to be the ſame; and a <hi>Demurrer</hi> confeſſes not the Truth of that, which by Law cannot be ſaid; But if it may be ſaid, and is ſaid plainly, Then the <hi>Demurrer</hi> confeſſes it.</p>
            <p>I conceive the matter is well averrable, and We have well averred; I grant, <hi>a Repugnant and impoſſible Averment cannot be taken;</hi> But if there be no impoſſibility, repugnancy, or contradiction, between the matters averred to be the ſame; it is not only allowable to averr it, but moſt proper; For, <hi>quod conſtat clare, non debet verificari;</hi> In this Caſe, 'tis not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it ſhould appear upon view of the <hi>Indictment</hi> and <hi>Impeachment;</hi> that the matter contained in both, is the ſame; But its ſufficient, that it be provable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Iſſue to be taken; and ſo much is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35279:58"/>admitted by the <hi>Judges,</hi> in <hi>Sparrye's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co.</hi> 5. <hi>Rep.</hi> 51.—If this matter may appear at firſt or at laſt, and the thing is poſſible to be proved, We are well enough, <hi>Corbet</hi> and <hi>Barnes Caſe firſt, Croke fol.</hi> 320.</p>
            <p>By taking the <hi>Averment,</hi> We offer them here a fair <hi>Iſſue, an Iſſue of fact try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by a Jury;</hi> but the <hi>Attorney</hi> refuſes that; and having <hi>demurred,</hi> it muſt be taken to be true, as if found by a <hi>Jury;</hi> And, if they had taken <hi>Iſſue</hi> upon this <hi>Queſtion of fact,</hi> We might have gone to a <hi>Jury,</hi> where the matter would have been eaſily proved; For upon evidence given, <hi>The</hi> Jury <hi>might fairly take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the reading of this very Nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Libel, ſet forth in the</hi> Indictment, <hi>and the particular and ſpecial</hi> Debates, <hi>of the</hi> Houſe <hi>of</hi> Commons <hi>thereupon: And that, upon thoſe very</hi> Debates, <hi>the</hi> Houſe <hi>voted that</hi> Fitz-Harris <hi>ſhould be</hi> Impeached <hi>for matters in that</hi> Libel, <hi>and that upon thoſe Votes, the</hi> Impeachment <hi>was carryed up to the Lords;</hi> This is Evidence ſufficient, that the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> intended to accuſe him of the ſame <hi>Treaſon;</hi> which proves the <hi>Iſſue</hi> (viz.) <hi>That the Treaſon in the</hi> Impeachment, <hi>is the ſame with that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35279:59"/>in the</hi> Indictment; This is not to put the Intention of the Mind, or ſecret Thoughts of the Heart in iſſue, but to put them into a way of proof—In the preſent Caſe, the <hi>Intention</hi> of the <hi>Commons,</hi> upon the <hi>Iſſue</hi> we offered, and the <hi>Attorney</hi> refuſed, might, and ought, and would have been proved, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, found by the <hi>Jury;</hi> Neither is this <hi>general Impeachment</hi> ſuch a notion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing as is pretended; but 'tis, as if the <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould ſay, We charge him with Crimes that are <hi>Treaſon;</hi> Now, whether thoſe Crimes are the ſame, with thoſe for which he is Indicted, is a good and proper <hi>Iſſue;</hi> And if it appears to the <hi>Court</hi> to be the ſame, <hi>you will certainly take off your Hands from theſe Proceedings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, they ſay, <hi>The Impeachment is too general, and no Man ſhall be put to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſuch a general Accuſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſay ſo too; neither ſhall <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> be put to anſwer to it, without ſpecial <hi>Articles;</hi>—But here, <hi>by the Law of Parliament, general Impeachments are held good;</hi> and <hi>Articles,</hi> and <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Articles</hi> alſo, are uſually brought in afterwards; And therefore, We muſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35279:59"/>take the <hi>Impeachment</hi> as We find it, which ſtands againſt us as a Record, and We muſt plead it in the ſame generallity.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Impeachment,</hi> according to the courſe of <hi>Parliament,</hi> is well lodged in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords;</hi> where it only ought to be tryed; and we muſt plead it, as we find the Caſe to be: And having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred the Crimes to be the ſame; We have done what we could, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enough. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a general</hi> Impeachment <hi>without Articles, is a bar to any</hi> Indictment <hi>for the ſame matter,</hi> was reſolved by all the <hi>Judges (as I am informed)</hi> in the Caſe of the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower, who were indicted for Treaſon,</hi> and afterwards (5th of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1678.) <hi>generally Impeached,</hi> and no <hi>Articles</hi> exhibited, till the 3d of <hi>April,</hi> 1679; And yet, in the mean time, the <hi>Judges reſolved it at the</hi> Council-Table, <hi>that they could not be proceeded againſt upon thoſe</hi> Indictments; <hi>tho' the</hi> Parliament <hi>was diſſolved.</hi> That was a ſtronger Caſe, than this of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> for there, the <hi>Inferiour Court</hi> was firſt poſſeſſed of the Cauſe, and yet, the <hi>general Impeachment tyed up the Hands of the Court;</hi> But here, the <hi>Parliament</hi> was firſt poſſeſt of the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35279:60"/>Cauſe; which the <hi>Inferiour</hi> Court cannot take out of their Hands.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Impeachment</hi> differs alſo from an <hi>Indictment,</hi> in that in an <hi>Indictment</hi> you cannot plead <hi>auter foitz Arraigned;</hi> but muſt plead <hi>Auter foitz Convict, or Acquit;</hi> as in Sr <hi>William Wiſhople</hi>'s <hi>Caſe;</hi> But in an <hi>Impeachment,</hi> They will acknowledge, that after <hi>Articles</hi> exhibited, They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed upon an <hi>Indictment,</hi> for the ſame Offence; although the Defendant be neither Convict or Acquit.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more, but obſerve how ſerupulous the <hi>Judges</hi> have been, to touch upon a Caſe, where they had the leaſt ſuſpition that the <hi>Parliament</hi> had, or pretended a <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> or were poſſeſſed of the Cauſe; <hi>I am ſure, I could never obtain any thing by any Labours of mine in thoſe Caſes; But upon ſuch Motions They (being aware of the Conſequence) would alwayes worſhip afar off, and never come near the</hi> Mount: <hi>They ever retired, when They came near the Brink of this</hi> Gulf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord!</hi> If you retain this Cauſe; in conſequence <hi>you charge your ſelves with this Mans Blood,</hi>—I leave it to your Wiſdom to conſider it.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:35279:60"/>
            <p>Then <hi>Mr Pollexfen</hi> proceeded thus; I ſhall not make any long Argument; But I would fain come to the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> if I could; for I cannot ſee what the other ſide make the Queſtion; Our <hi>Plea</hi> is objected againſt, both for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form; But, if for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it be admitted, <hi>that an</hi> Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>for the ſame matter, will out this Court of</hi> Juriſdiction, I will ſay nothing of it, for that is not then in Queſtion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> aſſented to this, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>No, not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Mr Pollexfen</hi> added, The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſeems to be agreed, and only the manner and form of the <hi>Plea</hi> are in queſtion; for the manner, they ſay, 'tis not alledged there is any <hi>Impeachment</hi> upon Record; I confeſs Form is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile matter in it ſelf, and 'tis eaſie for one that reads other Mens Words, to make what Conſtruction he will of them, even <hi>Nolumus</hi> to be <hi>Volumus;</hi> To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the <hi>Objection,</hi> I think 'tis as ſtrongly and cloſely penn'd, as can be; <hi>He was Impeached, Quae quidem Impetitio, &amp;c.</hi> What can the <hi>Quae quidem</hi> ſignifie, but the <hi>Impeachment</hi> juſt mentioned before.</p>
            <p>The great Queſtion now is, whether
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35279:61"/>this be not too general, to alledge that he was <hi>Impeached</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and not ſaying how, or for what Crime; tho' there be an <hi>Averment</hi> that 'tis for the ſame Crime; whether this <hi>Plea</hi> ſhould therefore be naught.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> For this of the <hi>Averment,</hi> be the Crimes never ſo particularly ſpecified in the Record that is pleaded, and in that upon which the party is brought in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature; yet there muſt be an <hi>Averment,</hi> which is ſo much the ſubſtantial part of the Plea, that without it, it would be naught; and it muſt come to be tryed <hi>Per Pais,</hi> whether the Offence be the ſame or not; Then the Objection to the generallity, is not to the ſubſtance, but rather an Objection to the Form, on their ſide, becauſe the <hi>plea alledges</hi> the ſubſtance, that 'tis for the ſame <hi>Treaſon;</hi> which, had not <hi>Mr Attorney</hi> demurred, but taken Iſſue on, muſt have been tryed <hi>Per Pais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſpeak to the general Allegation; that he was <hi>Impeached</hi> for <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and not ſaying particularly, what the fact was.</p>
            <p>If they admit the Law, <hi>That an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment ſuſpends the Juriſdiction of this Court;</hi> They admit a great part of the fact; and then the <hi>Queſtion</hi> will be, what <hi>Impeachment</hi> will take away the <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction?</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:35279:61"/>and there can be but two ſorts; the one at large, where the Offence is ſpecified; the other in general words, where the <hi>Commons Impeach</hi> ſuch a one of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> Now, if ſuch an Impeachment be good, then have we the moſt plain Caſe pleaded that can be; as plain as the Fact; that this is an <hi>Impeachment</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and then this <hi>Court</hi> is ouſted of its <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Court,</hi> and <hi>We,</hi> are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the proceedings in other <hi>Courts;</hi> as other <hi>Courts</hi> are to take notice of the proceedings of this; generally the <hi>Writ</hi> or <hi>Declaration</hi> (as 'tis in <hi>Sparrye's Caſe</hi>) does in all Civil Cauſes, ſet forth the particularity of the thing in queſtion; yet in ſome Caſes it doth not do ſo; but the Courſe and Practice of ſome Courts admits general proceedings; Now where that is ſo, the party cannot mend himſelf, by making their Courſe otherwiſe then it is; for he muſt not ſay, it is more particular then the Courſe of the Court does make it; Therefore, he hath no other way by the Law, to bring his matter on, and help himſelf, but by an <hi>Averment</hi> that 'tis the ſame; — The Law muſt be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35279:62"/>by its own proceedings, and take notice of the nature of the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before the Court; and if there is as much of certainty ſet forth, as the Caſe will admit, and is poſſible to be had; We muſt permit the party to plead as he can, and help himſelf by the <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, Whether an <hi>Impeachment, generally be good or no?</hi> If they ſay, it is not, then the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the <hi>Plea</hi> is naught, and all is quite gone; But if they ſay it is, then I have pleaded my matter as it is; For I cannot ſay, that that is particular, or make that particular that is not; and I have done all that is poſſible for me to do in my Caſe; I have pleaded what is in the <hi>Record,</hi> and as 'tis in the <hi>Record,</hi> from which my <hi>Plea</hi> muſt not vary; and <hi>I have averred 'tis for the ſame matter,</hi> and you have confeſſed it by the <hi>demurrer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not entangle the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> but I ſee not how they can extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a general <hi>Impeachment</hi> is good.</p>
            <p>In <hi>December</hi> 1678. the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi> were Indicted, and after (<hi>Decem.</hi> the <hi>5th</hi>) the <hi>Commons</hi> conſidering that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35279:62"/>it was intended to bring them to <hi>Tryal</hi> before the <hi>Peers;</hi> They, purpoſely to have the carriage and proſecution of this horrid <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and to take off the Proſecution upon the <hi>Indictment; Impeach</hi> the <hi>Lords,</hi> and the <hi>Impeachment,</hi> is juſt the ſame as this in our <hi>Plea;</hi> of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> but not of any particular Fact; Now the <hi>Judges</hi> took ſo much notice of it, that tho' the <hi>Parliament</hi> was diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, before the particular <hi>Articles</hi> were carried up; yet in <hi>February</hi> following (<hi>ſome of the</hi> Judges <hi>are here, and they will rectifie me, if I am miſtaken</hi>) the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Judges</hi> being asked about it, at the <hi>Council-Board;</hi> upon the <hi>Petition</hi> of the <hi>Lords,</hi> to be either bailed or tryed; <hi>They declared, that the</hi> Impeachment, <hi>tho' thus general, was ſo depending in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that they could not be tryed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We</hi> have pleaded, as our Fact is, an <hi>Impeachment</hi> of <hi>Treaſon;</hi> what would They have had us to do, or wherein is our fault? What would They have had us ſaid, We were <hi>Impeached</hi> of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> ſo and ſo particularizing? how can that be? There is no ſuch thing; Then they would have us ſaid, <hi>Nul tiel Record,</hi> and We muſt have been condemned for failing in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35279:63"/>our <hi>Record;</hi> then indeed we had been, where They would have had us; but having done according to our Fact, if that Fact will ouſt this <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> I ſee not how we ſhould plead otherwiſe; or what anſwer they will give to it.</p>
            <p>This muſt needs be agreed to me; <hi>If this Impeachment be in the nature of an Appeal;</hi> ſurely an <hi>Appeal</hi> does ſuſpend the Proceedings upon an <hi>Indictment</hi> for that Fact; and ſo 'tis expreſly, in my <hi>Lord Dyer,</hi> fol. 296. <hi>Stanley</hi> was indicted and convicted of Murder, and before Judgment, the <hi>Wife</hi> brought her <hi>Appeal;</hi> and They moved for <hi>Judgment;</hi> No, ſaid the <hi>Court,</hi> here is an Appeal brought; They could not go to <hi>Judgment</hi> till the <hi>Appeal</hi> was determined; So the <hi>Stat.</hi> 3. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. and <hi>Vaux's Caſe,</hi> 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 39. If this then be of the nature of an <hi>Appeal,</hi> this Suit ought to have its Courſe and Determination, before you proceed on this <hi>Indictment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inferiour Courts</hi> have never taken upon them to meddle with the Actions of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Courts;</hi> but leave them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to their Laws; and if that be done in any Caſe, there will be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35279:63"/>as much regard had, in this great Cauſe to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> as in others.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Northumberland's</hi> Caſe, (<hi>Cotton's Records</hi> 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. fol. 426.) He confeſſes himſelf guilty of an Offence againſt his <hi>Allegiance;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> would have the <hi>Juſtices</hi> to conſider of it; No, ſaid the <hi>Parliament, 'tis matter of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the</hi> Judges <hi>have nothing to do with it;</hi> The <hi>Lords</hi> make a <hi>Proteſtation</hi> to this purpoſe, and went on themſelves, and adjudged it to be no <hi>Treaſon;</hi> There is that <hi>Record</hi> more, <hi>Rot. Parl.</hi> 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Pars</hi> 1. <hi>N.</hi> 6. I only offer theſe things, with what my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> ſayes, <hi>Hath been formerly thought Prudence in the</hi> Judges <hi>to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I hope, That <hi>if the matter be good, the form is as good as the matter can be put into;</hi> and therefore we hope you will allow us the benefit of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Attorney General</hi> argued thus for the <hi>King;</hi> Notwithſtanding what hath been ſaid, I take it, this is a <hi>Naughty Plea;</hi> and there is no matter diſcloſed therein, that we can take <hi>Iſſue</hi> upon.</p>
            <p>The great ſubſtance of the <hi>Arguments</hi> of the <hi>Priſoners Counſel</hi> is againſt him;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35279:64"/>for 'tis leaſt he ſhould eſcape, but he pleads this <hi>Plea</hi> that he might eſcape.</p>
            <p>For the Cautions given you; what a difficult thing it is, for two <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> to interfeir; <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that matter, who hath forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Life to the Law; yet he would fain live a little longer; and is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the <hi>Judicature</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould be preſerved.</p>
            <p>I obſerve 'tis an unuſual <hi>Plea;</hi> It concludes <hi>Si Curia procedere vult;</hi> I wonder they did not put in, <hi>aut debeat;</hi> you have no Will but the Law, and if you cannot give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you ought not to be preſſed in it; but it being according to Law, that <hi>Malefactors</hi> be brought to condign pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, We muſt preſs it, whatſoever the Conſequences are; It is the Intereſt of all the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as well as of the <hi>King,</hi> that ſo notorious a <hi>Malefactor</hi> ſhould not eſcape, or the Truth be ſtifled, but brought into Examination in the face of the Sun; but They ſay, if it be not Law, you will not proceed, it ties up your Hands; But they give not one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to make good what they ſay.</p>
            <p>Put the Caſe, it had been a good <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:35279:64"/>&amp; he had been arraigned upon it and acquitted; and had afterwards come to be Indicted in this <hi>Court,</hi> and would not plead this in <hi>Bar,</hi> but to the <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> it would not have been a good <hi>Plea;</hi> Then certainly, an <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> depending ſingly, cannot be a good <hi>Plea</hi> to the <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Court</hi> hath a full <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of this <hi>Caſe,</hi> and of this <hi>Perſon;</hi> and this you had at the time of the Fact commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; What then is it, that muſt ouſt this Court of <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> For all the Caſes that have been put, about matters not originally examinable in this <hi>Court,</hi> make not to the matter in queſtion; where the Fact is done out of the <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> that may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> but, where the <hi>Court</hi> may originally take <hi>Cognizance</hi> of it, I would know, what can ouſt that <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> leſs than an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> I will be bold to ſay, the <hi>King</hi> by his <hi>Great Seal</hi> cannot do it. To ſay the <hi>Proceedings</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> ought to be a <hi>Bar;</hi> that is another Caſe, the Party may plead it in <hi>Abatement</hi> or <hi>Bar,</hi> as the Caſe requires: For the <hi>Caſes</hi> they put, the Reaſons are, that the <hi>Court</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:35279:65"/>had no <hi>Original Juriſdiction.</hi> There is not one of the <hi>Caſes</hi> cited, but where it was out out of the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Court originally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Caſe</hi> of the <hi>five Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower;</hi> I obſerve the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the <hi>Indictments</hi> into their, <hi>Houſe;</hi> fore-ſeeing that the <hi>King</hi> might have proceeded upon them, if not removed thither; But our Caſe is quite another thing, for thoſe <hi>Lords</hi> were not fully within your <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Caſe</hi> of 11. <hi>R.</hi> 2. will be nothing to our purpoſe at all; that was in the <hi>Caſe</hi> of the <hi>Lords Appellants; a proceeding contrary to</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>contrary to the</hi> Statute <hi>of</hi> Edw. 3. <hi>and the known Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Subject.</hi> Thoſe proceedings had a Countenance in <hi>Parliament;</hi> and they would be controuled by none, nor be adviſed by the <hi>Judges;</hi> but proceed to the trying of <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Commoners,</hi> according to their own Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: And between the time of 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. and 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. ſee what Havock they made by thoſe illegal proceedings, and in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. theſe very <hi>Lords</hi> were ſentenced; and it was reſolved by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> That no more <hi>Appeals</hi> ſhould be any more in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:35279:65"/>
            <p>The other great point is this; There is nothing at all certainly diſcloſed to you by this <hi>Plea;</hi> therefore, there is nothing confeſſed by us, only the Fact that is well pleaded.</p>
            <p>They ſay, They have pleaded it to be, <hi>ſecundum Legem &amp; Conſuetudinem Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti;</hi> but I ſay, They muſt diſcloſe to you what is the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in ſuch Caſe; or you muſt take it upon you, upon your own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or you cannot give Judgment.</p>
            <p>There are three things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> the <hi>Legiſlative part, the matters of Priviledge, and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial part;</hi> For the two firſt, both <hi>Houſes</hi> proceed only <hi>Secundum Legem &amp; Conſuetudinem Parliamenti;</hi> But for the <hi>Judicial</hi> part, they have in all times been guided by the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land;</hi> and have been ouſted of a <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> in ſeveral Caſes; as by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. And the <hi>Lords,</hi> in all <hi>Writs of Error</hi> and matters of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> proceed, <hi>Secundum Legem Terrae,</hi> and ſo for <hi>Life and Death;</hi> And there is not one Law in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> as to matters of Judgment, and another in the <hi>Lords Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:35279:66"/>
            <p>It is not ſufficiently diſcloſed to you, that there is any ſuch thing as an <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> depending there; 'tis only alledged that he was <hi>Impeached,</hi> and ſo much the <hi>New-Books</hi> told us; but to infer thence, that there was an <hi>Impeachment</hi> carried up, and lodged for the ſame <hi>Treaſon;</hi> is no conſequence, And then 'tis alledged, <hi>Quae quidem Impetitio,</hi> when no <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is before ſet forth; but only that he was <hi>Impeached</hi> generally.</p>
            <p>When a <hi>Record</hi> is pleaded in <hi>Bar,</hi> or in <hi>Abatement;</hi> the Crimes ought to be ſet out, to appear the ſame; ſo are all the <hi>Preſidents</hi> of <hi>Cok</hi>'s <hi>Entries</hi> 53. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft</hi> and <hi>Burgh</hi>'s <hi>Caſe,</hi> and <hi>Watt</hi>'s and <hi>Bray</hi>'s <hi>Caſe,</hi> in 41 <hi>&amp;</hi> 42 <hi>Eliz. Cok</hi>'s <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> 59. <hi>Wrot</hi> and <hi>Wigg's Caſe</hi> 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 45, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Record</hi> muſt be ſet out, that the <hi>Court</hi> may judge upon it, and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> muſt not be tryed <hi>per Pais,</hi> but by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Wallop</hi> was of opinion; that upon this <hi>Averment,</hi> the <hi>Jury</hi> may try the Fact; what a pretty Caſe would it be, that a <hi>Jury</hi> ſhould judge upon the whole debates of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there it be the ſame matter or No?</p>
            <p>I did <hi>demur</hi> with all the care I could,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35279:66"/>to bring nothing of that in queſtion; I take it there is nothing of that matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, concerning an <hi>Impeachment</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending before the <hi>Parliament;</hi> but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was done, 'tis ſo imperfectly pleaded, that this Court cannot take any notice of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Soticitor General's Argument</hi> was to this effect, <hi>The Point in queſtion is, whether this Plea be ſufficient in point of Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They on the other fide, argue the Plea to be good both in matter and form— I will not now debate, whether, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which Ordains that every Man ſhall be tryed by his <hi>Peers,</hi> and the <hi>Statute</hi> 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which ſays, that the <hi>Lords</hi> ſhall not be compelled, nor ſhall have power, to give <hi>Judgment</hi> upon a <hi>Commoner,</hi> have ſufficiently ſecured the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> from <hi>Impeachments;</hi> Nor is it the queſtion before you, <hi>whether you ſhall judge of any matter that is a Right or Priviledge of Parliament;</hi> This is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment</hi> for <hi>Treaſon.</hi> Neither will it be the <hi>Queſtion, whether an</hi> Impeachment <hi>depending in the</hi> Houſe of Lords <hi>againſt a Commoner, by the</hi> Commons; <hi>will bar this</hi> Court <hi>of its</hi> Juriſdiction.</p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:35279:67"/>
            <p>They ſay, the <hi>Commons</hi> are the <hi>grand Inqueſt</hi> of the Nation, and They make their <hi>Preſntments</hi> to the <hi>Lords;</hi> Now, when ſuch a <hi>Preſentment</hi> is made, 'tis worthy conſideration, whether it be not a <hi>Preſentment</hi> for the <hi>King;</hi> for an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> does not conclude, as an <hi>Appeal</hi> does; but, <hi>contra Ligeantiae ſuae debitum, &amp; Coronam &amp; digintmem demini Regis;</hi> ſo far 'tis the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Suit;</hi> In an <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the Witneſſes for the <hi>Priſoner</hi> are not ſworn, neither hath the <hi>Priſoner</hi> Counſel in matter of Fact, as he has in an <hi>Appeal</hi> at the <hi>Subjects Suit;</hi> The <hi>King</hi> may pardon part of the Sentence; It was ſo done in <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond's time; and in my <hi>Lord Stafford's</hi> Caſe, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, that 'tis the <hi>Suit</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> yet that cannot preclude the <hi>King</hi> from his <hi>Suit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſequence which they urge, as ſuch a diſmal one, will be nothing; which is, If he ſhould be acquitted here, he could not plead <hi>auter foitz acquit,</hi> and ſo would be twice brought in Jeopardy for the ſame Offence; for it is the ſame in all Caſes of <hi>Appeals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not like the Caſe of an <hi>Appeal</hi> for Murder, neither; for tho' it hath
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35279:67"/>been uſed diſcretionarily, to ſtay the <hi>Suit</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> and prefer the <hi>Subjects Suit;</hi> it was becauſe the <hi>Subject</hi> had the neareſt concern; as the <hi>Son</hi> in the Death of the <hi>Father;</hi> The reaſon of that turns quite contrary here; in this Caſe, that very reaſon, will have the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Suit</hi> to be preferred; for there is no <hi>Treaſon</hi> but againſt the <hi>King,</hi> he has the neareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and the wrong is primarily and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now, for the <hi>Objection, that if you try this Man, upon the ſame reaſon you may try the</hi> Lords in the Tower; Their Caſe is different, and the <hi>Lords</hi> removing the <hi>Indictments</hi> againſt them into <hi>Parliament,</hi> that no Proſecution might be upon them; ſeems to imply, that this <hi>Tryal</hi> may be in this Caſe; for certainly they thought, the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Court</hi> might proceed; had not the <hi>Indictments</hi> been removed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the form of the Plea;</hi> I conceive 'tis not a <hi>formal Plea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know here, of no form of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>Indictment,</hi> but what ſets forth the <hi>Indictment</hi> particularly; 'tis ſo in all the Preſidents I have ſeen; and the Law-Books reſolve it muſt be ſo, as <hi>Wrott</hi> and <hi>Wiggs</hi> Caſe;</p>
            <p>But they ſay, there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:35279:68"/>their Caſe, and thoſe I put; for that 'tis the Courſe of <hi>Parliament</hi> to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach generally?</hi> ſo they could not have pleaded otherwiſe then the Caſe was; This Reaſon holds rather the other way; For if in any Caſe ſuch a general way of pleading, with reference to the Record, were to be admitted, it were in Caſe of an <hi>Indictment;</hi> becauſe there is no <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but what particularly ſets forth the <hi>Felony;</hi> and when produced, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being applyed; but here, if the <hi>Record</hi> be brought in, 'twill no more aſcertain the matter of the <hi>Impeachment,</hi> then the <hi>Plea</hi> does already.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Plea</hi> is naught, for not ſetting out the <hi>Record;</hi> ſo is the <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> inſufficient too; for the he does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verr, <hi>That the Treaſon in the</hi> Indictment <hi>and the Treaſon for which he was</hi> Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>are one and the ſame, and not diverſe, affirmatively and negatively,</hi> yet he ought to have ſaid; <hi>That the Treaſon for which he is</hi> indicted, <hi>and the Treaſon mentioned in the</hi> Impeachment <hi>it one and the ſame;</hi> For if he was Impeached generally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mention of particulars; it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be reduced to a certainty; ſo 'tis an Averment of a Fact, not capable to be tryed.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:35279:68"/>
            <p>We do think upon the whole matter, without entring upon the debate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a particular <hi>Impeachment,</hi> lodged in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> does preclude the <hi>King</hi> from his proceedings; We have a good <hi>Caſe</hi> upon this <hi>Plea,</hi> for that is not a Queſtion neceſſary to be reſolved, tho' it be not granted by the <hi>King</hi> neither; But the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, whether this be a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Plea;</hi> and whether here be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent matter ſet forth upon a <hi>Record,</hi> to bring the other matter into Queſtion, and tye up the hands of the <hi>Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Serjeant Jefferies</hi> then ſaid, I ſhall only offer one word to the <hi>informality</hi> of the <hi>Plea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They cite the <hi>Caſe</hi> of the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> as a Judgment for them, which ſeems to be againſt them; for by the, <hi>Lords</hi> removing the <hi>Indictments</hi> into <hi>Parliament,</hi> They ſeem to be of Opinion, that notwithſtanding they were <hi>Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> before the <hi>Lords,</hi> yet there might have been proceedings upon thoſe <hi>Indictments,</hi> had they not been removed; and there they remain to this day; nay further, to thoſe <hi>Impeachments</hi> they have pleaded to Iſſue, which is ready for Tryal; but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:35279:69"/>in the Caſe at the Bar, there is only an accuſation, without any further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings thereupon.</p>
            <p>I take not this to be ſuch a dangerous Caſe, as the <hi>Gentlemen of the other ſide</hi> do pretend, for you to determine; For I am ſure it will be better for the Court to anſwer, if ever they ſhall be required; That they have performed their Duty, and done Juſtice according to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, &amp; Oathes; than ever to be afraid of any <hi>Threats</hi> or <hi>Bugbeares</hi> from the <hi>Bar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For would not they by this manner of Pleading, put upon your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> a difficulty to judge; without any thing contained in the <hi>Impeachment</hi> to guide your Judgment; whether the Priſoner be <hi>Impeached</hi> for the ſame thing for which he is Indicted? May not the Treaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this <hi>Impeachment</hi> be Cliping or Coyning?</p>
            <p>We rely upon the informality and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the Pleading only; and meddle not with the Queſtion, whether an <hi>Impeachment</hi> in the <hi>Houſe of Lords</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedes an <hi>Indictment</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench;</hi> For We ſay, they have not Pleaded it ſo ſubſtantially, as to enable the Court to <hi>Judge</hi> upon the Queſtion; and therefore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:35279:69"/>We pray your Judgment that the <hi>Plea</hi> may be over-ruled.</p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Francis Wythens</hi> added, I ſay that this <hi>Plea</hi> cannot be good to ouſt this <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Juriſdiction;</hi> The <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſhall by no means be admitted to averr the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> before they have declared it themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conceive the Plea to be naught, for that reaſon; alſo for another, becauſe the <hi>Court,</hi> in this Caſe, by any thing expreſſed in the Plea, cannot diſcern or takenotice, whether it be the ſame <hi>Treaſon</hi> or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Treaſon</hi> generally alledged in the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,</hi> is the <hi>Genus,</hi> and the <hi>particular Treaſon</hi> in the <hi>Indictment,</hi> is only a <hi>Species;</hi> And the <hi>Averment</hi> in the <hi>Plea</hi> is, That the <hi>Genus</hi> and the <hi>Species</hi> is the ſame; which is abſurd; and if allowed, tends to <hi>hood-wink and blind the Court,</hi> inſtead of making the matter plain for their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The <hi>Arguments</hi> being ended,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid; <hi>We</hi> never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when <hi>We</hi> aſſigned four <hi>Council</hi> to <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> that they all ſhould make <hi>formal Arguments,</hi> in one day; 'tis the firſt time that ever it was done; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35279:70"/>'tis in a <hi>Caſe of Blood; We</hi> were willing to hear all you could ſay: But I muſt tell you, you have-ſtarted a great many things, that are not in the Caſe at all: <hi>We have nothing to do here whether the</hi> Commons, <hi>at this day can</hi> Impeach <hi>a</hi> Commoner <hi>in the</hi> Houſe of Lords; <hi>nor what the Juriſdiction of the</hi> Lords <hi>is; nor whether an</hi> Impeachment <hi>(when the Lords are poſſeſſed fully of it) does bar the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Suit, or hinder the Proceeding in an</hi> Inferiour Court; but here We have a Caſe, that riſes upon the Pleadings, Whether your <hi>Plea</hi> be ſufficient, to take away the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> as you have pleaded it; And you have heard what <hi>Exceptions</hi> have been made to the form, and to the matter of your <hi>Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> We ask you again, whether you are able to mend your <hi>Pleading</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing; for the <hi>Court</hi> will not catch you, if you can amend it, either in matter or form; But if you abide by this <hi>Plea,</hi> then We think 'tis not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor will be expected of us, in a matter of this Conſequence, to give our Judgment concerning this <hi>Plea,</hi> preſently.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Caſes</hi> cited, concerning <hi>Facts
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:35279:70"/>done in Parliament, and where they have ender voured to have them examined here,</hi> are nothing to the purpoſe, for We call none to queſtion here for Words ſpoken, or Facts done in the <hi>Commons Houſe,</hi> or in the <hi>Lords;</hi> which takes off the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances you have given, but our <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>barely upon the Pleading of ſuch an</hi> Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be <hi>ſufficient to fore-cloſe the Hands of the</hi> Court? And we will not precipitate in ſuch a Caſe, but deliberate well upon it, before we give our <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Take back your Priſoner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> May 11th, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was again brought to the <hi>Bar,</hi> and the <hi>Attorney</hi> moved for <hi>Judgment</hi> on the <hi>Plea,</hi> and</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> thus delivered the Opinion of the Court; Why, <hi>Mr Fitz-Harris,</hi> you have pleaded to the <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> that there was an <hi>Impeachment</hi> againſt you, by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> before the <hi>Lords;</hi> and you do ſay, that that <hi>Impeachment</hi> is yet in force; and by way of <hi>Averment,</hi> that this <hi>Treaſon</hi> whereof you are Indicted, and that whereof you are <hi>Impeached,</hi> are one and the ſame <hi>Treaſon;</hi> And upon this, the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:35279:71"/>
               <hi>Attorney</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> hath <hi>demurred,</hi> and you have joyned in <hi>demurrer;</hi> And we have heard the <hi>Arguments</hi> of your <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> and have conſidered of your Caſe among our ſelves; and upon full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and deliberation concerning it, and all thath hath been ſaid by your <hi>Counſel;</hi> And upon conference with ſome other of the <hi>Judges; We</hi> are, three of us, of <hi>Opinion,</hi> that your <hi>Plea</hi> is not ſufficient to bar this <hi>Court</hi> of its <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;</hi> my <hi>Brother Jones,</hi> my <hi>Brother Raymond,</hi> and <hi>my ſelf,</hi> are of Opinion, your <hi>Plea</hi> is inſufficient; My <hi>Brother Dol</hi>-been not being reſolved, but <hi>doubting</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; And therefore, the <hi>Court</hi> does order and award, that you ſhall anſwer over to this <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon he pleaded <hi>Not guilty,</hi> and the Court appointed his Tryal to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> in the next <hi>Term.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 9th of <hi>June</hi> 1681.</p>

               <hi>Attorney General</hi> enlarged upon it, and called the Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Everard</hi> teſtified, that he and <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> became acquainted in the <hi>French King's Service;</hi> and <hi>F.

               <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> then demanded of <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> Whether he was not put upon this to trapan others? which <hi>Everard</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, with this queſtion, Can you mention any Perſon that I was to <hi>trapan?</hi> But being again asked, Whether he was put upon it, to trapan the <hi>Proteſtant Lords</hi> and the <hi>Houſe of Commons?</hi> He ſaid, No, I was not. I was put upon it by none but <hi>Pitz-Harris,</hi> of whom I asked, what will be the uſe of this? and he ſaid, <hi>We will deſperſe them, We know how;</hi> And that he was to deliver it to the <hi>French Ambaſſador's Confeſſor,</hi> and it was to be drawn in the Name of the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> to father it upon all the diſcontented party.</p>

               <hi>Mr Smith</hi> then gave evidence, that he was planted in a Cloſet in <hi>Everard's</hi> Chamber, and ſaw him and <hi>F.

               <hi>Sr William Waller</hi> was then ſworn, and declared, that he was placed in a Room within <hi>Everards</hi> Champer, where through a crevaſs of the Door, and a Hole in the Hangings, he could ſee him and <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> and he heard <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of <hi>Everard,</hi> whether he had finſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Paper, according to his Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and <hi>Everard</hi> produced two Papers, and gave him one; and after he had read a little in it, <hi>Everard</hi> asked whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was drawn according to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; and he anſwered, It was, exactly done; And that <hi>Everard</hi> ſaid, This is a buſineſs of very dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:35279:73"/>what Reward ſhall, I have for running ſo great a hazard; and he told him; I think I run an equal hazard with you, for you have a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per under my Hand, which will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me liable to danger; and <hi>Sr William</hi> ſaid, he ſaw <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> after ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages with his Pen, and then, the Paper being produced, he declared it to be the ſame; And that <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> told <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard,</hi> that the <hi>French Ambaſſador</hi> was to Recompence him for his pains.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> demanded of <hi>Sr William;</hi> Whether that were the Paper for which he was Impeached, and <hi>Sr William</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that at was, and that he read that Paper in the Houſe, And <hi>Mr John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> Fore-man of the <hi>Jury,</hi> demanded whether <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> ſtood Impeached upon the ſame Treaſons in the Indictment; and <hi>Sr William</hi> anſwered that he did, but being checkt by the <hi>Attorney</hi> and <hi>Solicitor General,</hi> he ſaid, That as ſoon as he had communicated that Paper to the Houſe, the Houſe proceeded to the <hi>Impeachment.</hi>

                        <p>I Thank you for the Character of a Popiſh Succeſſor which you ſent me, wherein out Juſt Fears, and the grounds of them, are juſtly ſet out. But I am in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fear of the preſent Poſſeſſor, why do we frighten our ſelves about the Evil that is to come, not looking to that which is at hand? We would cut off the Budding Weeds, and let the Poyſonous Root lie ſtill; We would ſtop the Channel of our Evils, and let the Fountain ſtill run: My meaning is this, can <hi>Pylades</hi> Know and Act all theſe Bloody Conſpiracies, and not impart them to his dear <hi>Oreſtes?</hi> if <hi>James</hi> be Conſcious and Guilty, <hi>Charles</hi> is ſo too: Believe me, theſe two Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Iniquity, they are in Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Government, as all their Actions demonſtrate: the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and Liberty of the Subjects are as heavy Voaks which they would caſt off to be as abſolute as their Br. of <hi>France;</hi> and if this can be proved to be their only aim and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:35279:74"/>why ſhould not every True Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be a <hi>Quaker</hi> thus far? Let the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> riſe, and move as one Man to ſelf-defence, to open Action, and fling off their intollerable Riders. Blow the Trumpet, ſtand on your Guard, and withſtand them as Bears and Tygers, And ſince there can be no triſt given to this goodly couple of Popiſh Brethren, nor no relief expected from a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Truſt to your Swords in defence of your Eives, Laws, Religion and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, like the ſtout Earl of Old, who told a King, that if he could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> he would be relieved by <hi>Longa Sedda.</hi>

                        <p>The Grand-Father of theſe Men, <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> was of no Religion at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, but entred by a pretence of a Sham-Plot of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt his Life, whilſt really he collogued with the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under-hand; his Mother, his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Companions were <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> when came into <hi>England,</hi> he wrote to the Pope with great Submiſſion,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:35279:74"/>yet afterwards thinking it for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to cajole the Parliament, and write againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinals,</hi> he ſends a <hi>Scots.</hi> Bird to blind the Eyes of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Keeper with Money, and to ſteal his <hi>Letters</hi> from off the <hi>Roman File;</hi> and then he crows as boldly as an unſuſpected Harlot for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> and <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That Man's Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, held a ſecret Correſpondency with the <hi>Pope,</hi> calling him his Dear and Holy <hi>Father,</hi> as is to be ſeen in his <hi>Letters</hi> recorded in <hi>Ruſworth</hi>'s Collections? Were not his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Courtiers Papiſts?</hi> Did he not countehance and promote the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland?</hi> As the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Grandees &amp; his very Commiſſions teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and declare, was there not a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and an Univerſal <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> diſcovered to him and his Confeſſor <hi>Laud,</hi> and did they not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtifle it leſt they ſhould have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Nakedneſs of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church? Whilſt that goodly <hi>Proteſtant Prince</hi> pretended to relieve the poor beſieged <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at <hi>Rochel</hi> by his confident <hi>Buckingham,</hi> did he not hold Correſpondency with the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:35279:75"/>
                           <hi>French Cardinal</hi> how to betray them for a Sum of Money (which his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy with his Parliament made him ſtand in need of.) But they who ſo ill approved themſelves to be heads of the <hi>Proteſtant Church, Charles</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> did they not looſe their own Heads by a manifeſt Judgment of God? And was not the falſe Heart of their Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>Buckingham,</hi> found out by an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins Kinfe?</p>
                        <p>But to come nearer to our purpoſe, theſe two goodly Imps of our days are ſtark naught; arrived at the heigth of Wickedneſs, and of profeſſed <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarineſs</hi> and <hi>Popery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As for <hi>James,</hi> he was a <hi>Papiſt</hi> whilſt he had a Regiment in the <hi>French,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas.

Have they not all along maintained ſecret Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

Can there be any thing more evident than that he continues the <hi>Duke's</hi> Adherents, and thoſe who were advanced by him, in all Offices of Truſt? And hath he not turn'd out of his Council the moſt Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Shaftesbury, Eſſex</hi> and others, and introduced in their Rooms other meer Tools, or thoſe that are <hi>Popiſhly</hi> and <hi>Arbitrarily</hi> affected?

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:35279:76"/>the further detection of the <hi>Popiſh Plot?</hi> And doth he not to his utmoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance the Diſcoverers of it, and ſuffer them to want Bread? And doth he not in the mean time plentifully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and reward <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> and all the Sham-Plotters? Whereas <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> had 8 <hi>l.</hi> a week whilſt a Forger of <hi>Plots</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> he is caſt off with ſcorn, and in danger of his Life ſince he laid open the <hi>Popiſh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer,</hi> Is not <hi>Charles</hi> ſo much in love with his <hi>Popiſh Iriſh Rebels</hi> (therein treading in his Fathers ſteps) that he promotes <hi>Montgarret Carlingford; Fitz-Ratrick</hi> and others, who were the Heads of the <hi>Rebellion,</hi> to Honours and Preferment; tho' <hi>Charles</hi> took the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and a Coronation Oath to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Proteſtaut Religion,</hi> yet hath he not palpably broken them? He made large promiſes and proteſtations at <hi>Breda</hi> for the allowing a perpetual Liberty of Conſcience to <hi>Non-conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtants,</hi> but he ſoon forgot them all: To what end was the Act which was made ſoon after his Reſtoration, prohibiting any to call him <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or to ſay he was <hi>Popiſhly</hi> enclined, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:35279:77"/>render ſuch as ſhould offend, Guilty of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> but to ſtop the Peoples Mouthes when ever he ſhould Act any thing in Favour of <hi>Popery</hi> as he was then reſolved to do?</p>
                        <p>Is it not manifeſt therefore, that <hi>Scotch</hi> Oaths, <hi>Breda</hi> Promiſes, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Profeſſion, Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> War with <hi>France,</hi> ſaving of <hi>Flanders</hi> is all in Jeſt to delude <hi>Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</hi> Is it not apparent that breaking of Leagues, <hi>Dutch</hi> War, <hi>Smirna Fleet, French</hi> meaſures to favour their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, loſs of Ships, War in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Blood of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> reprieving of <hi>Popiſh Traytors,</hi> is all in earneſt, and done in favour of <hi>Popery?</hi> And are not his fair Speeches, his true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Love to <hi>Parliaments,</hi> juſt Rights, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liberties, his pretended Ignorance of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and his Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Traytors to ſerve a turn but in meer jeſt?

            <p>Sr <hi>Philip Lloyd</hi> and Mr <hi>Bridgman, Clerks</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> then teſtified; that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> acknowledged the Paper of Inſtructions given to <hi>Everard,</hi> to be his own hand-writing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Priſoner</hi> then called his <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> and Dr <hi>Otes</hi> teſtified, that after the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was talked abroad, he diſcourſed <hi>Everard</hi> about the <hi>Libel;</hi> and asked him what the deſign of it was; <hi>and he told
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:35279:79"/>him it was to be Printed, and ſent by the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury Poſt. to the</hi> Proteſting Lords, and leading Men <hi>of the</hi> Commons; <hi>and they were to be taken up, as ſoon as they had it, and to have it found about them;</hi> And that <hi>Everard</hi> told him, the <hi>Court</hi> had a hand in it; and the <hi>King</hi> had given <hi>Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> Money already, and would give him more if it had ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheriff Corniſh</hi> was then called, and the <hi>Priſoner</hi> demanded of him, what the <hi>King</hi> ſaid to him, when he came to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> from him from <hi>New-Gate;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>King</hi> did ſay <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was employed by him, and received any Money, and what for?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sheriff</hi> anſwered; when I gave his <hi>Majeſty</hi> an account that I found the <hi>Priſoner</hi> diſpoſed to make a Diſcovery, he was pleaſed to tell me, he had often had him upon Examination, and could make nothing at all of what he did ſay, or diſcover to them, and that he had for near three Months before acquainted him, that he was in purſuit of a <hi>Plot, and the</hi> King <hi>did ſay, That in as much as he made great Proteſtation of Zeal for his Service, he did Countenance and give him ſome Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:35279:79"/>
            <p>Mr <hi>Attorney,</hi> (ſeeming to be under a ſurprize at this Evidence) demanded of the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> whether the <hi>King</hi> ever decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he ſaw <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> in his Life, or that he ever was in his Preſence, Mr <hi>Sheriff</hi> anſwered, yes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Attorney</hi> ſaid, Ay! but did the <hi>King</hi> ſay he ever ſaw him, before he was Arreſted for this Fact?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sheriff</hi> replyed, yes, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> ſaid he came to him about three Months before, and pretended he would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a great <hi>Plop to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Priſoner</hi> called <hi>Colonel Manſel,</hi> and demanded what he heard Sr <hi>William Waller</hi> ſay, after the Diſcovery was made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colonel Manſel</hi> teſtified, that he heard Sr <hi>W. Waller</hi> ſay; that when he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the <hi>King</hi> with this buſineſs, he told him, he had done a great piece of Service, and gave him thanks; but that Sr <hi>William</hi> was no ſooner gone, but two worthy <hi>Gentlemen</hi> told him, that the <hi>King</hi> ſaid, he had broken all his meaſures, and he would have him taken off one way or another; And <hi>Colonel Manſel</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Sr <hi>William</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the deſign was againſt the Proteſtant</hi> Lords <hi>and the Proteſtant</hi> Party.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Serjeant Maynard,</hi> upon hearing this, declared, that he did not doubt, that it was againſt the <hi>Proteſtaut</hi> Party.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hunt</hi> being called by the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> ſaid, that Sr <hi>W. Waller</hi> told him and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That the <hi>King</hi> gave him particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thanks for detecting <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi> but that he was told by two <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of undoubted Credit, that heard the <hi>King</hi> ſpeak it; that his <hi>Majeſty</hi> was in extream Paſſion, and ſaid, <hi>He would give any thing to take him out of the World; that he was an inſufferable vexation to him, and that he had broken all his meaſures;</hi> and that <hi>Sr William</hi> ſaid the ſame at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the prefence of Sr <hi>Philip Harcourt,</hi> and of my <hi>Lord Radnor</hi>'s Son, Mr <hi>Roberts;</hi> and did alſo ſay, it was a deſign, to make theſe Papers Evidences of <hi>Rebellion;</hi> and that this was the Counter part of <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s <hi>Plot;</hi> and that he hoped he would not deny it, if he be asked, here he is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sheriff Bethel</hi> then teſtified, that <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi> told him, he wrote the <hi>Libel,</hi> and that before <hi>Everard</hi> knew him, or heard him ſpeak a word in his days, he put in an Information of Treaſon againſt him, at the inſtigation of his Mortal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:35279:80"/>and it was ſo groundleſs, that tho' it was given in three years ago, he never, heard a word of it till Friday laſt.</p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Wall</hi> was then called by the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; he demanded of her, whether he had not conveyed ſome <hi>Libels</hi> and <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> Papers to the <hi>King</hi> by her means, and received Money upon that account? but <hi>ſhe</hi> would not acknowledge it.</p>
            <p>He then asked her, whether it was not about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> was twelve Month, that he gave her the <hi>Libel</hi> about the <hi>King</hi> and her <hi>Lady;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> thanked him extreamly, and he had 250 <hi>l.</hi> given him? and he ſaid to her, Come Mrs <hi>Wall,</hi> don't think to trick me out of my Life, can you deny that I had the 250 <hi>l.</hi> ſpeak, had I the 250 <hi>l.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>VVall</hi> anſwer'd, That was not the Queſtion you ask's me at firſt, There was 250 <hi>l;</hi> I think it was 200, or 150, or 250 <hi>l.</hi> you know it was not for any <hi>Libel</hi>—you once told me, you could bring in People to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi>'s Intereſt, that were very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State</hi> deſited to know who they were, and you named one <hi>Thomas Merry</hi> and my <hi>Lord Howard</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:35279:81"/>of <hi>Eſcrick;</hi> and the <hi>Secretary</hi> deſired me to get him in if I could.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> then demanded of her, whether he did not come to her the <hi>Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday</hi> before he was taken, and tell her he deſired to ſpeak with the <hi>King;</hi> and that he had a <hi>Libel</hi> to preſent to him.</p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Wall</hi> anſwered, No, it was the <hi>Thurſday;</hi> you deſired me to bring you to the Speech of the <hi>King,</hi> which was a thing you never deſired before; and you ſaid, you believed you could ſay ſomething to him, that might do him Service, but <hi>ſhe</hi> denyed that he ſaid any thing to her of the <hi>Libel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon further queſtions put to her, ſhe ſaid that <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> was never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>King,</hi> and that the <hi>King</hi> never took notice of him, or ſpoke to him, by her means; and that the Money was paid for the bringing of my <hi>Lord Howard,</hi> who came firſt to her two years ago; and whether it be a year and an half ſince his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> met with the <hi>King,</hi> ſhe ſaid ſhe could not tell.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Cowling</hi> declared, That Mrs <hi>Wall</hi> told him, that the ſecond or third night before he was taken, <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:35279:81"/>came to her, to bring him to the <hi>King,</hi> but ſhe asked him why he did not go to one of the <hi>Secretaries,</hi> and he ſaid that he could not do that without being taken notice of, and that ſhe then ſaid to him, Write down your Buſineſs, and I will carry it to the <hi>King;</hi> and he ſaid, No, I will not do that; and that ſhe thereupon replyed, I muſt then beg your pardon, if I don't bring you to the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Howard</hi> then teſtified, That about ten or fourteen days before the Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>October</hi> laſt; <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> applyed to him in the <hi>King's</hi> name, to have him wait upon the <hi>King,</hi> but that he declined it, and that he then preſſed his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to wait upon the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and when he came to her, he found the <hi>King</hi> there; his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> added, that if the 250 <hi>l.</hi> were given for bringing him thither, he feared the <hi>King</hi> did not think he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it; That about ten days after he ſaw the <hi>King</hi> again by the means of <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> and that when the <hi>Parliament</hi> was ended, he waited again upon the <hi>Dutcheſs,</hi> and then requeſted her to repreſent <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> his condition to the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:35279:82"/>
            <p>His <hi>Lordſhip</hi> further acknowledged (upon the Queſtion put to him by <hi>F.

            <p>Here, Dr <hi>Otes</hi> deſired leave to go away, ſaying, the Crowd was ſo great he could not ſtand; upon which, Mr <hi>Attorney</hi> ſcoffingly ſaid, my <hi>Lord,</hi> that may be part of the <hi>Popiſh Plot</hi> to keep Dr <hi>Otes</hi> here, to kill him in the Crowd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Priſoner</hi> then demanded of the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Portſmouth's</hi> Porter, how long it was ſince he paid him the Money from my <hi>Lady Portſmouth,</hi> but he ſaid he could not tell, it was ſo long.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Earl of Arran</hi> was then called by the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and acknowledged upon his queſtions, that he did ſhew him a <hi>Libel,</hi> (perhaps it was this) the day he was taken, and his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> told him, he would do himſelf a miſchief one time or other by meddling with ſuch Papers; and that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:35279:82"/>they drank a Bottle or two of Wine and parted, and that as ſoon as his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> came home, he heard <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> was taken.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord Conway</hi> and <hi>Seoretary Jenkins</hi> denied that the <hi>King</hi> did own that he had employed <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> but my <hi>Lord C.</hi> acknowledged, that he had heard the <hi>King</hi> ſay, <hi>he did formerly employ him in ſome</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Making a Proteſtant Plot, or ſo.</note> 
               <hi>trifling things;</hi> and that he had got Money of him; and that, his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſaid, was for my <hi>Lord Howard</hi>'s Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; He added, that the <hi>King</hi> never ſpoke with him till after he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Portſmouth</hi> then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> asked her, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was not employed to bring Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to the <hi>King,</hi> and amongſt the reſt the <hi>Impeachment</hi> againſt her <hi>Grace;</hi> and he ſaid that thereupon ſhe told him, that it was a great piece of ſervice to bring thoſe ſort of Papers; and that he told her he knew one Mr <hi>Everard,</hi> who knew all the <hi>Intrigues</hi> and <hi>Clubs</hi> in the <hi>City;</hi> and could tell all the deſigns of my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and all that Party; and her <hi>Grace</hi> encouraged him to go on, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:35279:83"/>by her means he came to ſpeak with the <hi>King</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> anſwered, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay to Mr <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> nor was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in any ſort of Buſineſs with him; he deſired me to give a Petition to the <hi>King,</hi> to get his Eſtate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I ſpoke three or four times to the <hi>King</hi> about it, and he had the Money for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> ſaid, I am ſorry your <hi>Grace</hi> is ſo much under Mrs <hi>Wall</hi>'s Influence; and then addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Court</hi> ſaid; I will tell you what I know, ſince my <hi>Witneſſes</hi> will not; I ſhall rely upon the Conſciences of the <hi>Jury</hi> for the Iſſue; Tho' my <hi>Lady Portſmouth, Mrs Wall</hi> and the reſt ſay, that I was not employed, nor recieved Money for ſecret Services, yet 'tis very well known I did ſo; As to <hi>Everard,</hi> he told me, he was well acquainted with my <hi>Lord Shaftesbury,</hi> and my <hi>Lord Howard,</hi> and he knew their <hi>Intrigues</hi> in ſeveral <hi>Clubs</hi> in the <hi>City;</hi> I humoured him in his diſcourſe, and diſcourſed him to reduce the Paper he accuſes me of, under ſome heads; And I no ſooner had the Paper, but I came to <hi>White-Hall</hi> with it; and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:35279:83"/>was adviſed to go to my <hi>Lord Clarendon,</hi> or Mr <hi>Hide,</hi> and ſhew'd it to a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> who was to give it to my <hi>Lord Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon,</hi> but before he could get to him, I was taken; What I did was with deſign to ſerve the <hi>King,</hi> according as I was employed, tho' both the <hi>Secretaries</hi> will not declare it; Theſe are great Perſons that I have to do with, and where great State matters are at the bottom, 'tis hard to make them tell any thing, but what is for their Advantage; and ſo I am left in a ſad Condition.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Jury</hi> Convict me, They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Law and Courſe of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> Whereas if they bring me in Not Guilty, my <hi>Impeachment</hi> ſtands good ſtill, and I am liable to anſwer it before the <hi>Parliament;</hi> I hope you will conſider the Perſons I have had to deal with, and that it cannot be made ſo plain, as in matters wherein We deal with common Perſons. I deſire notice may be taken that Sr <hi>William Waller</hi> declares, that for this very thing, I was <hi>Impeached</hi> by the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Solicitor General</hi> and Sr <hi>George Jeffryes</hi> ſummed up the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> directed the

               <hi>Jury,</hi> his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and the three other <hi>Judges, Jones, Dolben</hi> and <hi>Raymond,</hi> telling them, that they were ſworn to the Point, whether <hi>Fitz H.</hi> were guilty of the Treaſon or not; but that it lay not before the <hi>Jury,</hi> whether the <hi>Court</hi> have Authority to try him; that was a queſtion proper for the <hi>Judges</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and they had determined it.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, the <hi>Jury</hi> found him <hi>Guilty;</hi> Before the Sentence was paſſed upon him, he ſaid, that he thought it would be prejudicial to the <hi>Kings</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that Sentence ſhould paſs; before he had made an end of the <hi>Evidence</hi> he had given in againſt my <hi>Lord Howard;</hi> but the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, They could take no notice of any thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and he was Sentenced to dye as a Traytor, which was Execnted the <hi>1ſt.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1681.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That in</hi> March 1680. <hi>he met</hi> Father Patrick <hi>at</hi> Paris, <hi>and talking of a Rupture that might be between</hi> England <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>the</hi> Father <hi>ſaid, that the</hi> French <hi>intended in ſuch Caſe, to ſend</hi> Marſhall Bellfonds <hi>into</hi> Ireland, <hi>with</hi> 10000 Foot, <hi>and</hi> 2000 Horſe, <hi>and</hi> Arms <hi>and</hi> Ammunition <hi>for</hi> 30000 Men <hi>to be raiſed there; and the</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>promiſed the</hi> Examinant <hi>a</hi> Regiment <hi>of the</hi> Men <hi>to be ſo Raiſed, and the deſign
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:35279:86"/>was to reſtore that</hi> Kingdom <hi>to its former Owners in Subjection to</hi> France.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Father Patrick <hi>deſired him to ſend him all the</hi> Libels <hi>that came out in</hi> London, <hi>and ſaid, that</hi> Libelling <hi>the</hi> King <hi>was a thing neceſſary in order to diſtaſte and make him jealous of his People; that the</hi> Examinant <hi>knew</hi> Mr Everard <hi>at</hi> Paris <hi>in</hi> 1665, <hi>and hath ſince encreaſed his acquaintance with him; and that the Opinion of</hi> Father Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick <hi>about</hi> Libelling <hi>the</hi> King, <hi>incouraged the</hi> Examinant <hi>to concur with</hi> Everard, <hi>as to the</hi> Libel <hi>lately Written by</hi> Everard.</p>
            <p>It was moſt evident from the demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> (from the firſt to the laſt, after his apprehenſion) that he was ready to ſay, deny, affirm, or do any thing to ſave his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mrs Fitz-Harris</hi> (his Widow) upon the 15th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1681. depoſed, that her <hi>Husband,</hi> a little before his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, told her what great offers were made him at firſt, to have charged the <hi>Libel</hi> upon the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and my <hi>Lord Howard;</hi> and <hi>that he adviſed her to do it, as the only means to ſave his Life,</hi> tho' he proteſted at the ſame time, they were wholly innocent; and that ſhe was
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:35279:87"/>aſſured that ſhe ſhould have what Money ſhe pleaſed, if ſhe would accuſe thoſe <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Libel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> himſelf, the very Night before his Execution, wrote a Paper which he ordered to be delivered to his Wife, in order to prevent the ſpilling innocent Blood; informing her, by whom he was adviſed to accuſe thoſe <hi>Lords,</hi> and others of the <hi>Libels,</hi> and of having put him upon the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> and that he had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a Pardon to prevail upon him to do it; but finding that he was deluded, he declared, as before <hi>God;</hi> that they were innocent, and that what he had depoſed againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> was true, and <hi>that he had been only too ſparing, in accuſing great People among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that for about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes, between the time of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi> the poor wretch was wholly under the management of <hi>Dr Hawkins</hi> of the <hi>Tower;</hi> in which time, the <hi>Doctor</hi> having held ſeveral Conſults with ſome at <hi>Windſor;</hi> there was modelled a Paper, ſtuff'd with abominable Malice and Falſhood, to ſerve the wicked Deſigns of that day, which
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:35279:87"/>the <hi>Doctor</hi> after his Death, emitted to the World, under the Title of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Fitz-Harris,</hi> and therein he is made to declare abundance of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Falſhoods, in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Treaſon of the Libel came from the Lord Howard;</hi> But his Conſcience could not but witneſs, that he had at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times complained to <hi>Sheriff Bethel,</hi> and <hi>Sheriff Corniſh;</hi> that he had been preſſed to accuſe the <hi>Lord Howard,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Earl of Shaftesbury,</hi> of the Libel.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Sham Confeſſion</hi> proceeds to a <hi>Proteſtant Plot</hi> (viz.) <hi>that the</hi> Lord Howard <hi>told him of a deſign to ſeize upon the King, to carry him into the City, and there detain him, till he had yielded to their deſires; and that himſelf and</hi> Haynes <hi>were privy to the deſign, and had ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the Lord</hi> Howard.</p>
            <p>A ſtrange Tale of a <hi>Proteſtant Plot,</hi> between two <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant Engliſh Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place, this <hi>Mock-Confeſſion</hi> is to perſwade the World, that the <hi>Proteſtant Magiſtrates</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſuborn him to make a Confeſſion that might confirm a <hi>Popiſh Plot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It declares, <hi>That in</hi> Newgate <hi>the</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:35279:88"/>Bethel <hi>and</hi> Conniſh <hi>came to him, with a Token from the</hi> Lord Howard, <hi>and told him nothing would ſave his Life, but diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Popiſh Plot; and <hi>greatly encouraged him to declare, that he believed ſo much of the</hi> Plot, <hi>as amounted to the introducing the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks; <hi>or to criminate the</hi> Queen, his Royal Highneſs; <hi>or to make ſo much as a planſible Story to confirm the</hi> Plot.</p>
            <p>Beſides, That as it hath been heretofore obſerved, and is moſt undoubtedly true; that Neither of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> ever ſpake privately with <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> until he had been thrice examined by the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and ſworn to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Examination, taken by <hi>Sr Robert Clayton</hi> and <hi>Sr George Treby;</hi> So, this idle Tale in it ſelf, could never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the leaſt credit, in that it made the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> ſo fooliſh and vain, as to think a Declaration from ſuch a Wretch as <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> of his belief of the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> to have been of great value, and that it was worth a high Reward, for him to have invented a plauſible ſtory, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Plot, after the belief thereof, had been confirmed by many <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> by the <hi>Votes</hi> of four <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and the <hi>Condemnation</hi> and <hi>Execution</hi> of ſeveral of the <hi>Plotters.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:35279:88"/>
            <p>Further, <hi>Dr Hawkins</hi> his Paper brings in <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> charging it upon the <hi>Sheriffs;</hi> that they extorted from him falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions about the <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> and it makes him to ſpeak thus; <hi>I finding my ſelf in</hi> Newgate <hi>fettered, Monyleſs and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and I could ſee no other refuge for my Life, but complying with them</hi> (the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs) <hi>ſo, to ſave my Life I did comply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as ſoon as the <hi>Doctor</hi> had publiſhed this Sham, the falſhood thereof was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and the World rightly informed in the matter; that <hi>Fitz-H. was never fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, or put in Irons;</hi> but was treated with all imaginable civility, for which he thanked the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> even with his dying Breath.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor's</hi> impudent <hi>Libel</hi> then fell upon <hi>Sr Robert Clayton</hi> and Sr <hi>George Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;</hi> and inſinuates, that they would have induced <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> to ſay more than was true, and ſays, that what he depoſed before them about <hi>Father Patrick,</hi> was forced out of him, and was not true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. H.</hi> himſelf well knew, that Sr <hi>Robert Clayton</hi> and Sr <hi>George Treby,</hi> came to take his Confeſſion, upon his earneſt importunity; and that after he had been thrice examined by the <hi>Secretaries</hi> and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:35279:89"/>
               <hi>Attorney General,</hi> and he had ſworn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them all the matters in ſubſtance, contained in the Examination by Sr <hi>R. C.</hi> and Sr <hi>G. T.</hi> except that one paſſage about <hi>de Puy;</hi> and when that Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was read to the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> at <hi>Oxford; Secretary Jenkins</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that he had confeſſed the ſame to the <hi>Lord Conway,</hi> the <hi>Attorney General,</hi> and himſelf, except that about <hi>de Puy;</hi> yet, the <hi>Contriver</hi> of the <hi>Sham Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> took no care to retract, or excuſe his Swearing the ſame matters, before the <hi>Secretaries</hi> and <hi>Mr Attorney;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>Reaſon of State</hi> did at that day require, that not They, but the <hi>City Magiſtrates</hi> muſt be expoſed.</p>
            <p>Then, the impudence of Hell is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, to bring in <hi>Sr George Treby,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> to accuſe the <hi>Earl of Danby,</hi> and the <hi>Popiſh Lords</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> by ſpeaking thus; <hi>do but you ſay it, We have have thoſe that will ſwear it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had they been provided with falſe Witneſſes, and had they had ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed deſign; There was no need of <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> his ſaying any thing: Neither the falſe Suggeſtions, nor the Perjuries, could have gained any weight or credit
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:35279:89"/>from the Authority of <hi>Fitz-H.</hi> by his ſaying what they were to Swear.</p>
            <p>To conclude, there are Perſons who can unriddle this whole Myſtery, &amp; pull off the Diſguiſes and Vizors, wherewith this affair is even to this day obſcured; and therefore, I have made this Recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of the fore-going particulars, to incite thoſe who are better able, to oblige the World, with a more full knowledge of the vile Practices, with this poor, deluded, timerous Wretch; and then it may be evident, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> gave him expectation, if not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Life, to the very laſt Moment that he drew breath.</p>

               <note place="margin">It looks as tho <hi>Keel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> had been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>White-hall</hi> to make, as well as to diſcover this Plot, for of the very ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber accuſed of it, We have him here, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in three at once.</note> That upon <hi>Keeling</hi>'s diſcovery, he was put into the <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> for being at that Meeting, and abſconded about two Moneths, and then <hi>Mrs Gaunt</hi> came to enquire of his Wife for him, who brought her to him; and ſhe told him, that there were ſome Perſons about to make an eſcape, and <hi>ſhe</hi> would have him go along with them; and ſent him (with <hi>Rumbold</hi>) to <hi>Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-Hundred</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> to take Ship, but not liking the Veſſel, and the Weather being bad, they returned to <hi>London.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> then ſum'd up the Evidence thus, <hi>Burton</hi> ſayes this <hi>Woman</hi> was very ſolicitous to ſend him beyond Sea; That her <hi>Husband</hi> being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Plot,</hi> and ſhe (as <hi>Burton</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves) knowing that he could make ſome diſcovery concerning her <hi>Husband,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convey him away; It is true, there is not direct proof, that there was any particular mention that <hi>Burton</hi> was in the <hi>Proclamation;</hi> but <hi>he</hi> and his <hi>Wife</hi> ſay, that they verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Priſoner</hi> knew that he was in the <hi>Proclamation;</hi> and ſhe her ſelf being examined, ſays, that ſhe might hear that he was in the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and that his Houſe was ſearched, and he could not be found, and yet ſhe conceals him;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:35279:92"/>what could be the meaning of this, but that <hi>ſhe</hi> was very zealous to maintain the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> and was a great Aſſiſtant to all concerned in it? <hi>She</hi> will not tell you any other cauſe, why ſhe ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to convey this Man beyond Sea; and therefore, in all reaſon, you ought to conceive it was for this.</p>

                  <p>NOt knowing whether I ſhould be ſuffered or able, becauſe of Weakneſſes that are upon me, through my hard and cloſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, to ſpeak at the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I write theſe few Lines, to ſignifie I am well reconciled to the way of my God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, tho' it be in ways I looked not for, and by terrible things, yet in Righteouſneſs; for having given me Life, he ought to have the diſpoſing of it, when and how he pleaſeth to call for it; and I deſire to offer up my all to him, it being but my reaſonable ſervice; and alſo the firſt terms that Chriſt offers, that he that will be his Diſciple muſt forſake all and follow him; and therefore, let none think it hard, or be diſcouraged, at what hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto me; for he doth nothing without cauſe; in all that he hath done unto us; he being Holy in all his Ways, and Righteous in all his Works; and it is but my lot in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with poor deſolate <hi>Sion</hi> at this day; neither do I find in my heart, the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret of any thing that I have done, in the ſervice of my Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt, in favouring and ſuccouring any of his poor Sufferers, that have ſhewed favour to his righteous Cauſe; which Cauſe, tho' it be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:35279:93"/>now fallen and trampled on, as if it had not been anointed; yet it ſhall revive, and God will plead it at another rate, then yet he hath done, with all its Oppoſers, and malitious Haters; and therefore let all that love and fear him, not omit the leaſt duty that comes to hand, or lieth before them, knowing that Chriſt hath need of them, and expects that they ſhould ſerve him; and I deſire to bleſs him that he hath made me uſeful in my Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, to the comfort and relief of many diſtreſſed Ones, that the Bleſſing of thoſe that have been ready to periſh hath come upon me, and I have been helped to make the Heart of the VVidow to ſing; and I bleſs his holy Name, that in all this, together with what I was changed with, I can approve my Heart to him, that I have done his Will, tho' I have croſſed man's Will; and the Scripture that ſatisfied me in it, is the 16th of <hi>Iſa. 3, 4. Hide the Out-caſts, betray not him that wandreth; let my Out-caſts dwell with thee.</hi> Obadiah <hi>12.13, 14. Thou ſhouldſt not have given up him that eſcaped, in the day of diſtreſs.</hi> But Man ſaith, You ſhall give them up, or you ſhall dye for it. Now whom to obey, judge ye.

I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in the Lamb-like Will, to forgive all that are concerned; and to ſay, Lord lay it not to their Charge; but I fear and believe, that when he comes to make Inquiſition for Blood, Mine will be found at the Door of the furious<note n="*" place="margin">Wythens.</note> Judge, who, becauſe I could not remember things, through my dauntedneſs, at <hi>Burton's</hi> Wife &amp; Daughter's witneſs, and my Ignorance; took advantage thereat, and would not hear me, when I had called to mind, that which I am ſure would have invalidated their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and tho' he granted ſome things of the ſame nature to another, yet he granted it not to me; my Blood will be alſo found at
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:35279:95"/>the Door of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous Jury, who found me Guilty upon the ſingle Oath of an Outlawed man; for there was none but his Oath about the Money, who is no legal Witneſs, tho' he be pardoned, his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry not being recalled; and alſo the Law requires two Witneſſes in point of Life; and then about my going with him to the place mentioned, it was, by his own Words, before he could be Outlawed, for it was two Months after his abſconding, and tho' in a Proclamation, yet not high Treaſon, as I have heard; ſo that I am clearly murdered by you; and alſo bloody Mr <hi>Atterbury,</hi> who ſo inſatiately hunted after my Life; and tho' it is no profit to him, yet through the ill-will he bore me, left no Stone unturned, as I have ground to believe, until he brought me to this; and ſhewed favour to <hi>Burton,</hi> who ought to have dyed for his own Fault, and not to have bought his Life with mine: And laſtly, <hi>Richardſon,</hi> who is cruel and ſevere to all, under my Circumſtances, and did at that time, without all Mercy or Pity, haſten my Sentence, and held up my Hand that it might be pronounced; all which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the great one of all,<note n="*" place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> the ſecond.</note> by whoſe Power all theſe, and multitudes of more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:35279:96"/>Cruelties are done, I do heartily and freely forgive, as done againſt me: But as its done in an implacable mind againſt the Lord Chriſt, his Righteous Cauſe, and Followers, I leave it to him who is the Avenger of all ſuch Wrongs, and hath ſaid, <hi>I have raiſed up one from the North, and he ſhall come upon Princes as upon Morter, and as the Potter treadeth Clay,</hi> Iſa. <hi>41.25. He ſhall cut off the Spirit of Princes, and be terrible to the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. <hi>76.12.</hi> And know this alſo, that though you are ſeemingly fixed, and becauſe of the Power in your Hands, and a weighing out your Violence, and dealing with deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hand, becauſe of the old and new hatred, by impoveriſhing, and by every way diſtreſſing thoſe you have got under you; yet unleſs you ſecure Jeſus Chriſt, and his holy Augels, you ſhall never do your buſineſs, nor your Hands accompliſh your Enterprizes; for he will come upon you er'e you are aware; and therefore, O that you will be wiſe, inſtructed and learn, is the deſire of her that finds no Mercy from you,</p>

Armſtrong</hi> had fled, the <hi>Priſoner</hi> relieved and aided him with Money; and that, after he was <hi>Indicted,</hi> and ſued to the <hi>Exigent;</hi> beſides, a <hi>Proclamation</hi> followed upon his flight, which was a ſufficient notice to all the <hi>King's Subjects; Sr Thomas</hi> went by the Name of <hi>Henry Laurence,</hi> beyond Sea; by that Name the <hi>Priſoner</hi> held a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, and ſent him a Letter, dated the 21ſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and tells him, he had ſent him a Bill of <hi>Exchange,</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:35279:98"/>for 165 <hi>l.</hi> drawn upon his <hi>Brother, Iſrael Hayes,</hi> who was acquainted with <hi>Sr Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were not for theſe, receiving and nouriſhing of <hi>Traytors,</hi> they would not lurk at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as they do. The Letter was taken about <hi>Sr Thomas,</hi> and we ſhall prove it is the Priſoner's Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, and that <hi>Sr Thomas</hi> received the Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I hope you will take care,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But like good Men, they took all the care they could, to ſtop the Fountain of Blood, that to the ſcandal of the Nation had too long iſſued from the <hi>Old-Bayly.</hi>
               </note> by Convicting this <hi>Gentleman, to ſtop the Fountain,</hi> that iſſues ſo much ſupply to theſe Traytors, that lurk abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> then affirmed, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew <hi>Sr Thomas</hi> in his life.</p>
            <p>Then, the <hi>Indictment</hi> againſt <hi>Sr Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> was read, which was found the 12th of <hi>July;</hi> and Mr <hi>Glover</hi> proved a Copy of the <hi>King's Proclamation</hi> againſt <hi>Sr Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> dated the 28th of <hi>June,</hi> 1683.</p>
            <p>Then, <hi>Ezekiel Everis</hi> was ſworn, and teſtified, that in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1683, he was at <hi>Cleve</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> with the <hi>Lord Grey,</hi> who went by the name of <hi>Thomas Holt,</hi> and <hi>Sr Tho. A.</hi> came thither, by the

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Serjeant (Criſpe)</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered a parcel of Letters into the Court, and ſwore that he received them of the <hi>Lord Godolphin,</hi> and they had been ever ſince in his hands.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Godolphin</hi> then teſtified, that he received three Letters produced in Court, from Mr <hi>Conſtable,</hi> Mr <hi>Chudley's</hi> Secretary, who told him they were taken about <hi>Sr Thomas,</hi> that one of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Name, mentioned 150 Guineas returned to <hi>Henry Laurence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſtable</hi> teſtified, that he was preſent, when the <hi>Scout</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> apprehended <hi>Sr Tho.

            <p>
               <hi>Charles Davis</hi> teſtified, that taking Boat from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> he met <hi>Iſrael Hayes</hi> and <hi>Sr Tho. A.</hi> coming to take Boat, and <hi>Sr Thomas</hi> went with him in the Boat, and he told him his Name was <hi>Henry Laurence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Davis</hi> added, that he lodged a Month in one <hi>Briſcowe's</hi> Houſe at <hi>Amſherdam,</hi> where there was a <hi>Club</hi> every <hi>Thurſday;</hi> There were Mr <hi>Iſrael Hayes,</hi> Mr <hi>Henry Ireton,</hi> one <hi>Wilmore, Emerton, Dare,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Engliſh Merchants;</hi> and he heard them ſeveral times, abuſe the <hi>King</hi> at the <hi>Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Attorney General</hi> then ſhewed <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> a Letter, ſaying, It may be he will ſave us the labour of proving it; but Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> diſowning it,</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Walpoole</hi> was called, and Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> ſaid, he was my Servant, and went away, after a rate, that poſſibly would not be allowed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walpoole</hi> teſtified, that he ſerved <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> almoſt four Years and three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and did believe the Letter to be Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> his hand.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> ſaid, <hi>My Lord,</hi> in matters of <hi>Treaſon, I hope you will not admit of compariſon of hands and belief, for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>

            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:35279:100"/>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> anſwered, Yes, no doubt of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> replyed, It has not been ſo in other Caſes, that have not been Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; as particularly in the <hi>Lady Carr's</hi> Caſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, that is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, you take it from <hi>Algernon Sidney,</hi> but without all doubt, it is good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judge Wythens</hi> ſaid, Compariſon of Hands was allowed for good Evidence in <hi>Colman</hi>'s <hi>Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> anſwered, That, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, vaſtly differs; Thoſe Letters were found in his own Cuſtody; This was not found in my poſſeſſion, but in another Man's, and in another Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sr John Trevor,</hi> Counſel for the <hi>King,</hi> ſaid, This <hi>Gentleman</hi> was a Trader with the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> and made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts with them, which are entred in their Books; We will compare them with the Writing in this Letter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> then called <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Brittle,</hi> and demanded of them, where the Books were; and they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harman</hi> teſtified, that he knew <hi>Mr

            <p>
               <hi>Brittle</hi> teſtified, that he is <hi>Porter</hi> in the Street to the <hi>Eaſt-India-Company,</hi> and that he ſaw Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> write his Hand, to a Book ſhown to him.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Piercehouſe</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a Note,<note place="margin">Query, if not the ſame <hi>Peircehouſe</hi> in the Pannel of the Jury.</note> which he ſaid was Mr <hi>H.</hi> his, and that he ſuppoſed it to be his hand, and compared it with the hand in the Book, and ſaid, that he delivered the Goods upon it; and <hi>Walpoole</hi> then ſaid, he believed it to be <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> his hand.</p>
            <p>Then Mr <hi>Sturdivant</hi> was called, and they ſhew'd him the Letter, and he ſaid, Here is <hi>Joſeph Hayes</hi> writ, but I do not know it to be his Hand.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> warmly ſaid, that Mr <hi>Sturdivant</hi> ſwore he did know Mr <hi>H.</hi> his hand, before the <hi>Grand Jury;</hi> but Mr <hi>Sturdivant</hi> affirmed, the <hi>Common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant</hi> was under a miſtake.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:35279:101"/>
            <p>Then <hi>Sr John Trevor</hi> called for Mr <hi>Hardreſſe,</hi> but the<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Common Serjeant,</hi> as hath been elſewhere obſerved, upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Keeling's Plot,</hi> in 1683, boaſted what work that <hi>Plot</hi> would make, when it came into the <hi>City;</hi> We now have him pulling it into the <hi>City,</hi> by Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and find him, in this Caſe, appearing and exerting himſelf, in a three or four ſold capacity, (viz.) the <hi>Manager,</hi> (if not Contriver) of this proſecution; and a <hi>Counſel, Solicitor,</hi> and <hi>Witneſs,</hi> againſt the worthy <hi>Citizen,</hi> now deſigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> 
               <hi>Common Sejeant</hi> anſwered, That he was out of Town, before he could be ſerved with a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Letter was read, it was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <hi>Joſeph Hayes,</hi> and dated the 31ſt of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1683. directed to Mr <hi>Henry Laurence</hi> ſenior, at <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus, <hi>Sir, at your deſire I have ſent you a Bill, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The Letter and the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Books were then ſhewn to the <hi>Jury,</hi> and to the <hi>Priſoner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> denyed the Letter to be his Writing, and ſaid, 'Tis very ſtrange I ſhould not know my own hand; May not <hi>Counſel</hi> be admitted to plead, <hi>Whether compariſon of hands and belief, are any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:35279:101"/>in Criminal Cauſer?</hi> I have been informed, it hath been denyed to be evidence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ch. Juſtice</hi> told him he was under a miſtake; ſome body has put it into your Head, and puſſed you up with a vain Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; there is no ſuch thing, 'Tis a Fiction, a meer Whim, only ſaid by <hi>Mr Sidney,</hi> and no ground in the World for it.</p>

               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> replyed, Was it not ſo in the Caſe of my <hi>Lady Carr?</hi> there is a Record of that I ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> affirmed, it was not ſo, and ſaid, Don't talk of it,<note n="*" place="margin">It was in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Term 1669.

            <p>Mr <hi>attorney General</hi> ſaid, Beſides this compariſon of hands, <hi>We</hi> ſhall give an account of the Correſpondence of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's Brother,</hi> and that he received the Money of him; and then ſaid, <hi>Mr Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Serjeant,</hi> Where had you this Papery?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Serjeant,</hi> to ſhow his care and zeal in this matter, ſaid, <hi>Pray have a care of the Papers;</hi> and then gave evidence that he had them from my

               <hi>Zord Godolphin,</hi> and ſaid, This is an Account of the Receipt and Disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Money; Shew it Mr <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</hi>

               <hi>Conſtable</hi> ſaid, This is one of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers was taken out of <hi>Sr T. A's</hi> Pocket.</p>
            <p>It being ſhewn to the <hi>Jury,</hi> one of them demanded, whether any one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the hand, that was in that Note?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Attorney</hi> anſwer'd, No, but <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſwears, that <hi>Sr T. A.</hi> ſhew'd him a Bill, ſubſcribed <hi>Joſeph Hayes;</hi> for ſo many hundred <hi>Guilders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> ſaid, He ſays it was 160 odd Pounds; now the ſum of this Note is 161 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> which is the change of 150 <hi>Guineas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr North</hi> concluded, ſaying, We have done at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> then ſaid, Here is no body proves this Letter to be my hand, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; They only prove it by ſimilitude, and compariſon, and belief.</p>
            <p>I conceive there is but one Witneſs, that that Letter was found in <hi>Sr T. A</hi>'s hands. <hi>Everis</hi> ſays, he ſaw a Bill had my Name to it; Sir, you did not know me, nor ever ſaw my hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Everis</hi> anſwered, No, never in my Life.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> then ſaid, 'Tis only an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reputation; he heard it was my Bill; you ſaw no Money paid upon it, did you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Everis,</hi> No; but I ſaw a Letter from Mr <hi>Iſrael Hayes,</hi> that gave ſome account of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> ſaid, All this is but Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Circumſtance; and <hi>I thought in caſe of Treaſon there ought to be two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> and hope you will let it be ſo here; —here is no evidence but the Letter, and that is not two Witneſſes; There is no body has proved, the <hi>knowingly,</hi> in the <hi>Indictment;</hi> that runs, that I knew <hi>Sr T. A.</hi> and his <hi>Treaſon,</hi> that <hi>ought</hi> to be proved, but I am ſure 'tis not; your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſays that the <hi>Indictment</hi> and the <hi>Proclamation,</hi> are ſufficient notice, that he was a <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> that may admit of <hi>Counſel</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate it; There ought to be Witneſſes that could ſhew me to be concerned with him; which no Body in the World can prove; or that I ever ſaw him; and that <hi>Witneſs,</hi> that ſays he ſaw the Bill, or this Letter, does not know that I wrote it. There are them that ſay, they heard of Money paid upon this Bill, but there is not one of them ſays, he ſaw any Money
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:35279:103"/>paid; and theſe are ſeveral Witneſſes, every one to a ſeveral thing.</p>
            <p>Here is no proof, but by the <hi>Eaſt-India Porters,</hi> and thoſe who ſay, they believe this Eetter to be my hand; No body ſays he ſaw me write this Letter, or had any Correſpondence with <hi>Sr T. A.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they pretend there was Money paid beyond <hi>Sea;</hi> Is this <hi>Indictment</hi> well laid; for it is laid to be paid in <hi>London?</hi> The payment of Money beyond Sea, can be no evidence of the Fact upon this Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the <hi>Jury</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of matters ariſing in <hi>London</hi> only; If I am to be tryed for payment of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney boyond <hi>Sea,</hi> the fact ſhould have been laid there, and the <hi>Tryal</hi> were to proceed upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 2. <hi>The Indictment</hi> ſhould be taken, by Special <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> from the <hi>King;</hi> and the <hi>Tryal</hi> be in the <hi>County,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould chuſe; I deſire <hi>Counſel</hi> upon this point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> No, 'tis an idle Whim, and I would fain know the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> that put that fooliſh Notion into your head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes.</hi> If you will allow me <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> you ſhall hear who they are; I have been informed the Law is ſo.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:35279:103"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> We are of another opinion: If any whimſical Notions are put into you, by ſome <hi>Enthuſiaſtick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> is not to take notice of their <hi>Crochets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> proceeded, and ſaid, The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> are Strangers to me; There is is one that has been ſworn, to whom I have paid ſeveral thouſands of pounds, that ſays he does not believe it to be my hand; then he called <hi>Mr Sturdivant,</hi> who looking upon the Letter, ſaid, <hi>I do not believe it to be his hand;</hi> I have had dealings with him, and he hath given me many <hi>Receipts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> then ſaid, There have been a great many <hi>Forgeries;</hi> and this Letter is forged; there have been <hi>Forgeries</hi> ſo like, that the Perſons themſelves have not known their own hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> Every body knows, that a hand may be counterfeited, very like; in <hi>Mr Sidney's</hi> Caſe, Mr <hi>Wharton,</hi> a young <hi>Gentleman,</hi> not above one or two and twenty, ſaid, he could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to counterfeit any Man's hand what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> then told the <hi>Jury,</hi> that he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:35279:104"/>was not a Man of that Quality, to give <hi>Sr T. A.</hi> 150 <hi>Guineas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice. We all know you have been a very</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">The reſolution in that day, was to enſlave the City &amp; the Nation, and every one who was found to withſtand it, was treated with this ſort of Language, and then made a Traytor, if they found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuniry, unleſs by chance, as in this caſe, a Jury failed them.</note> 
               <hi>active Man, a buſie Fellow about the City; as forward a</hi> Spark, <hi>as any I know, of a great while.</hi> I don't know what you talk of your Quality, but We know your qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, <hi>you have always been factious and turbulent, againſt the</hi> King <hi>and the</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> then affirmed, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave, nor lent, nor returned, any ſum of Money to this Perſon; and then called Mr <hi>Langley,</hi> who teſtified, that a <hi>Letter</hi> was Counterfeited, and a Bill of <hi>Exchange</hi> for 450 <hi>l.</hi> and ſo exactly like, that if he had not known of it before he ſaw it, he muſt have owned it, for his hand; and the party that paid the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, paid it in his own wrong, for he never drew any ſuch Bill.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> added, Mr <hi>Common Serjeant</hi> had my Books ſeveral dayes in his hands,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:35279:104"/>
               <hi>where there is an Account of</hi> 20000 <hi>
                  <hi>l.</hi> between my Brother and me;</hi> and if I would ſet my hand to ſuch a Letter and Bill, and write my Name at length, is it not as reaſonable that I ſhould put the Name of <hi>Laurence</hi> in my Books; and if it were there, it would appear.</p>
            <p>Indeed, here is an Account produced, of divers parcels of Money disburſed, in little ſums; but, I appeal to the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> whether ever any Bill of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> was ever paid, in ſuch parcels; No <hi>foreign Bill,</hi> was ever paid by 3 <hi>l.</hi> or 5 <hi>l.</hi> or 20 <hi>l.</hi> at a time: it muſt be paid at the day, or it will be proteſted — here is a computation of a ſum, like to the ſum in the Bill; but theſe are Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not proof.</p>
            <p>Then Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> called <hi>Alderman Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fryes,</hi> to ſpeak to his Reputation and Converſation; who ſaid, that he had known him many Years, and never knew any hurt by him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> demanded of the <hi>Alderman,</hi> whether he had been at any of the <hi>Elections</hi> at <hi>Guild-hall</hi> for <hi>Mayors</hi> or <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> when <hi>Mr Bethel</hi> and <hi>Mr Corniſh</hi> and <hi>them People</hi> were choſen; and whether he had ſeen Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> there,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:35279:105"/>and how he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf?<note n="*" place="margin">It is true, that he was, upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, active in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the City-Rights; and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Common Serjeant had ever been as forward <hi>Sparks</hi> on the other ſide; &amp; that made them ſo intent, upon the deſtruction of every well deſerving, worthy Citizen, whom they could draw under an Accuſation.</note> A very forward <hi>active</hi> Man, I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alderman Jeffryes</hi> anſwer'd, I ſuppoſe I may have ſeen him there, but I cannot ſay any thing to his behaviour.</p>
            <p>Then Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> called Mr <hi>Pollet,</hi> Mr <hi>Lloyd,</hi> Mr <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> ſenior, <hi>Mr Withers</hi> junior, and <hi>Mr Hugh White,</hi> who gave a fair account of his dealing and Converſation. <hi>He</hi> then ſaid, that he would trouble the <hi>Court</hi> with no more Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Attorney General</hi> then ſaid, that he would call one Witneſs more againſt him; and ordered <hi>Atterbury</hi> the <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> to be ſworn, and the Letter was ſhewed to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atterbury</hi> ſaid, that he apprehended <hi>Mr Hayes,</hi> and brought him before the <hi>King,</hi> and was preſent when the Letter was ſhew'd to him, and the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord Keeper North,</hi> preſs'd him to own,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:35279:105"/>whether it was his hand or no; and he ſaid, he ſhould ſay nothing to it, if they could prove it upon him well and good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> contradicted this <hi>Miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> and <hi>Bloody Man,</hi> ſaying, his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> was not there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Atterbury</hi> anſwered, As I remember, the <hi>King</hi> was there; but by and by ſaid, he did only imagine the <hi>King</hi> was there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> then back't <hi>Atter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s Evidence, ſaying, I was there, what he ſays is true; you ſaid, <hi>I am not bound to accuſe my ſelf;</hi> 'tis true, you did deny that you knew <hi>Laurence</hi> or <hi>Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong;</hi> and 'tis as true you would not abſolutely deny the Letter, but ſaid, you were not bound to accuſe your ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes</hi> then ſaid, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I did hope, that in point of Law, my <hi>Counſel</hi> ſhould have been heard to thoſe things I mentioned; and I wiſh you would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me in it; But that being denyed him, he addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Jury,</hi> ſaying, Nothing has more troubled me, ſince my Confinement, than the imputation of <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> a thing I alwayes deteſted; I never knew any, the leaſt thing of the <hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> but by the <hi>Tryals,</hi> or other printed Papers; not one of the <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,</hi>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:35279:106"/>who have come in, or been taken, have charged me in the leaſt; nor did he himſelf accuſe me, with whom I am charged to have this Correſpondence. <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I deſire you to conſider, that 'tis my Life is concerned, &amp; I beg you would conſider what theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> have teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; They are not poſitive in any reſpect, nay, there are not two, to any one thing that is charge; <hi>Conſtable</hi> ſays, the Letter was found amongſt Sr <hi>T. A's</hi> Papers; he ſays no more; and here are not two Witneſſes to that; <hi>Everis</hi> tells you, he ſaw this Bill, but did not know my hand; There is No body tells you I wrote this Letter, but it is found in another Man's duſtody, in another Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> 'tis very hard, that by compariſon of hands, a man's Life ſhould be in danger; when, in leſſer Crimes, it has been denyed to be good evidence; and none of you can eſcape the ſame danger, if this be allowed to be evidence; for your hands may be counterfeited, as well as mine.</p>
            <p>If there had been any probability of my knowing him, it had been ſomething; but there is not one that teſtifies, that ever I knew him, nor indeed did I;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:35279:106"/>There is a great deal of Circumſtance made uſe of, upon the account of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with my <hi>Brother,</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> but, 'tis ſtrange, there ſhould not be ſome evidence, of a further Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between him and me, if there were that intimacy, that ſuch a Letter as this doth import.</p>
            <p>I muſt, with Reverence to the <hi>divine Majeſty</hi> ſay, and I call <hi>God, Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> to witneſs the truth of it; as I ſhall anſwer it to him, before whom, for ought I know, I am quickly to appear; that I never in my Life ſpoke with <hi>Sr T. Armſtrong,</hi> nor was ever in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, nor ever wrote to him, by the Name of <hi>Laurence,</hi> or any other Name; And I do ſolemnly ſay, in the preſence of <hi>God,</hi> that I never gave, ſent, lent, paid, or ordered to be paid, any Money, directly or indirectly, to <hi>Sr T. A.</hi> or <hi>H. Laurence,</hi> or to him by any other Name, or to his uſe; I ſpeak it without any counterfeiting or equivocation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen, There have been Overtures, if I would ſay ſome things, that my Life might be ſaved;</hi> and 'tis not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that I would run the Riſque of my Life, if by ſpeaking the Truth, I could
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:35279:107"/>ſave it—</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> did here appear enraged, and interrupted him, ſaying, What do you mean by this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes.</hi> I ſay—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> Ay, but you muſt ſay thoſe things that are decent and fit for us to hear; you muſt not inſinuate, as if the <hi>Government</hi> would make any ſuch Compacts as you talk of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes.</hi> I ſay that Mr <hi>Foſter</hi> told me—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> If you offer that, I can tell you a Story, that perhaps you will be very unwilling to hear; on my word, 'twill be very unpleaſant to hear it; you had better let thoſe things alone, for you will but draw a load upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes.</hi> I beſeech your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> to hear me—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> Yes, I will hear you, provided you keep within due bounds, but we muſt not ſuffer theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes.</hi> I ſay nothing but this, It has been told me, the way to ſave my Life is to confeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> As you repreſent it, 'tis a reflection upon the <hi>Government</hi>—you talk of Overtures having been made
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:35279:107"/>you; don't make me ſay, what I have no mind to ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Mr Foſter</hi> by Name told me, there was no way for me to eſcape, but by Confeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chief Juſtice.</hi> You had beſt call <hi>Mr Foſter,</hi> to know how he came to tell you ſo; If you do, I will tell you of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, of<note n="*" place="margin">The Story of the 4 or 5000 <hi>l.</hi> was this, an eminent <hi>Papiſt,</hi> very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, undertook to ſome of the Friends of Mr <hi>Hayes,</hi> that a <hi>Pardon</hi> ſhould be had, for 4000 <hi>Guineas</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> &amp; 1000 to himſelf; but he afterwards declared, that the <hi>King</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him therein, and told him, that he was adviſed, that he had better give that <hi>Popiſh Friend</hi> 4000 <hi>l.</hi> out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> than par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Hayes;</hi> but that he gave his <hi>Royal Word,</hi> that the Overture ſhould not hurt <hi>Mr Hayes;</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the <hi>murdering Adviſer</hi> of that <hi>King,</hi> doth here publiſh it, to inſinuate the <hi>Priſoner</hi>'s guilt.</note> 4 or 5000 <hi>l.</hi> that was offered for your eſcape, you had better forbear, or elſe I ſhall put you in mind, of a <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of ſome Body, that is at the <hi>Bar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr Hayes,</hi> My <hi>Lord,</hi> I was told that was the way; <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Jury,</hi> I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you the whole truth, with all the ſolemnity that becomes ani n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Man, &amp; not an ill Man—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that you have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:35279:108"/>heard, in all this evidence, is nothing but <hi>Circumſtance and Hear-ſay;</hi> and ſhall a Man's Life be taken away, for <hi>I believe,</hi> and <hi>I think,</hi> or <hi>I have heard?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I know you are my <hi>Fellow Citizens</hi> and <hi>Fellow Chriſtians,</hi> and of the ſame <hi>Reformed Religion</hi> that I am; and I hope you are ſworn into this ſervice without any prejudice againſt me; but with an impartial Reſolution to do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and therefore I cheerfully leave the matter with you; I am ſure, that if <hi>God</hi> help me and deliver me in this Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, that it is he and you under him, that preſerve my Life—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> The great Incertainties, Improbabilities and Conſequences in this caſe, I hope will be weighed by you; and make you the better to conſider the proof, which is made, by none but ſuch as are Strangers to me; ſince then, they know me not, I hope you will weigh it, before you give it againſt me; We muſt all dye, and I am ſure it wil be no grief to you, to acquit a Man that is innocent; I leave it with you: <hi>The Lord direct you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jenner</hi> the <hi>Recorder,</hi> to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the matter ſpoke thus; The <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> charged on the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> is of that
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:35279:108"/>ſort, that if he be guilty; he will be a juſt example, to terrifie others from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like; for if Traytors had not perſons to ſupply them with Money abroad, it may be, <hi>they would not have ſo much Courage to run away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſatisfied you, that <hi>Sr T. A.</hi> was indicted, that an Exigent was gone againſt him, upon that account; here was a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> and <hi>Sr T. A.</hi> named in it; and ſo, at his rate of talking, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder</hi> repeated the Evidence of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and concluded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> We think that his defence has been ſo little, and our proof ſo ſtrong, that you have good ground to find him Guilty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> then ſummed up the matter to the <hi>Jury,</hi> in a Speech of of a vaſt length, which was in ſubſtance this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the <hi>Jury,</hi> This is an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment</hi> of <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> againſt the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner</hi> at the Bar; and you are to try it, according to your evidence; The <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner's</hi> affirmation of his innocence, is not to weigh with you. Nay,</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, I cannot, but upon this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:35279:109"/>occaſion, make a little Reflection upon ſeveral of the horrid <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> that did not only, with as much ſolemnity, imprecate Vengeance upon themſelves, if they were guilty of any Treaſon; but thought they did <hi>God Almighty</hi> good ſervice in that helliſh <hi>Conſpiracy:</hi> It is not unknown, one of the Perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this <hi>Proclamation,</hi> did declare, they ſhould be ſo far from being eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Traytors,</hi> That they ſhould have Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies ſet up for them; and all this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence and enamel of <hi>Religion:</hi> Nay, I can cite to you, an inſtance of another of the <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> that after a full and evident proof, and plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, of having an hand in it, when he comes upon the Brink of Death, and was to anſwer for that horrid fact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great <hi>God,</hi> he bleſſed Almighty God, that he dyed by the hand of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner,</hi> with the <hi>Ax,</hi> and did not dye by the <hi>Fiery Tryal: He bleſſed</hi> God, <hi>at the place of Execution, that he dyed a</hi> Traytor <hi>againſt the</hi> King <hi>and</hi> Government, <hi>rather than dyed a</hi> Martyr <hi>for his</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>I think it neceſſary to make ſome Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon it, when Men under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Religion,</hi> are wound up to that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:35279:109"/>heigth, to foment Differences, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb and diſtract the Government, to deſtroy the Foundations of it, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſacred <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and his <hi>Royal Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and to ſubvert our Religion, and Liberty and Property; and all this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, upon pretence of doing <hi>God</hi> good ſervice.</p>
            <p>You are to go according to evidence; as the Blood of a Man is precious, ſo the <hi>Government</hi> alſo is a precious thing; the Life of the <hi>King</hi> is a precious thing; The preſervation of our <hi>Religion</hi> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing; and therefore, due regard muſt be had to all of them.</p>
            <p>I muſt tell you, in this horrid <hi>Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,</hi> there were ſeveral Perſons, that bore ſeveral parts; Some, that were to head and to conſult; <hi>there was a</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>to conſider;</hi> Others were deſigned to to have a hand, in the perpetrating of that horrid Villany, that was intended upon the Perſons of his <hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> and his <hi>Royal Brother,</hi> and with them, upon the Perſons of all his <hi>Majeſties Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects,</hi> that acted with duty, as they ought to do; There were others, that were to be aiding and aſſiſting (as in the caſe of the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> if you find him
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:35279:110"/>guilty) aiding, abetting, aſſiſting by Money, or otherwiſe, or harbouring any of thoſe Perſons, that were concerned therein.</p>
            <p>Then he recounted the Evidence given againſt the <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and made ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the ſame, as he thought fit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jury</hi> withdrew, and <hi>ſpent two hours in conſideration of the matter;</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, gave their <hi>Verdict</hi> (to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment and vexation of the <hi>Chief Juſtice, Common Serjeant</hi> and others) that the <hi>Priſoner</hi> was <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Attorney General</hi> thereupon ſaid, <hi>My Lord,</hi> tho' they have acquitted him, yet the Evidence was ſo ſtrong, that I hope, your <hi>Lorſhip</hi> and the Court will think fit, to bind him to his good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, during his Life.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>Mr At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,</hi> that is not a proper Motion, at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So the</hi> Priſoner <hi>was diſcharged, after he had been impriſoned five Months.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' <hi>Mr Hayes,</hi> to the eternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſome good Men, who were upon his <hi>Jury,</hi> came off with his Life; he was by this Proſecution, beaten out of as
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:35279:110"/>good and valuable a Trade, as moſt <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Drapers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> had; and was, by conſequence, highly impaired in his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time, Mr <hi>Roſwell,</hi> a very worthy <hi>Divine,</hi> was tryed, for Treaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Words in his Pulpit, upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of very vile and lewd <hi>Informers;</hi> and a <hi>Surry Jury</hi> found him Guilty of <hi>high Treaſon,</hi> upon the the moſt villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and improbable evidence, that had been ever given, notwithſtanding <hi>Sr John Talbot (no Countenancer of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters)</hi> had appeared with great genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and honour, and teſtified, that the moſt material <hi>Witneſs,</hi> was as ſcandalous and infamous a Wretch as lived.</p>
            <p>It was at that time given out, by thoſe who thirſted for Blood, that Mr <hi>Roſwel</hi> and Mr <hi>Hayes</hi> ſhould dye together; and it was upon good ground believed, that the happy deliver ance of Mr <hi>Hayes,</hi> did much contribute to the preſervation of Mr <hi>Roſwel;</hi> tho', it is very probable, that he had not eſcaped, had not <hi>Sr John Talbot's</hi> worthy, and moſt honourable deteſtation, of that accurſed Villany; prompted him, to repair from the Court of <hi>King's Bench,</hi> to <hi>King Charles</hi> the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:35279:111"/>ſecond; and to make a faithful repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Caſe to him; whereby, when <hi>inhumane bloody Jeffreyes,</hi> came a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after, in a tranſport of Joy, to make his Report of the eminent ſervice he, and the <hi>Surry Jury</hi> had done, in finding Mr <hi>Roſwel</hi> guilty; the King (to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment) appeared under ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, and declared that Mr <hi>Roſwell</hi> ſhould not dye. And ſo he was moſt happily delivered; and being, by this remarkable Providence of <hi>God,</hi> ſtill alive; he would (at leaſt in my opinion) do a very uſeful and ſeaſonable piece of ſervice to this Age, and to thoſe which are to ſucceed; in publiſhing a full Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the whole Proceedings againſt him.</p>

            <p>At that time the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> well knowing that his Innocence would not be able to guard him, againſt hired and ſuborned Raſcals, and <hi>pack'd Juries;</hi> and he remembring what baſe and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Arts had been uſed to deſtroy him; his Sagacity prompted him to put himſelf out of the reach of that implacable rage, which had ſo long purſued him; and in order to it, he concealed himſelf, for ſome time, in <hi>Mr Bateman's</hi> Houſe; and afterwards (till he retired into <hi>Holland</hi>) in the houſe of that worthy upright <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-man Captain Tracy,</hi> in <hi>Goodman's Fields,</hi> whoſe Life was therefore threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and eminently endangered, but the divine Providence delivered him, after he had ſuffered a long and cloſe Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment (in Irons) in <hi>Newgate,</hi> under the Tyranny of <hi>Richardſon.</hi>

               <hi>Mr Bateman</hi> was alſo the Refuge of that eminent and well-deſerving <hi>Citizen Sr. Patience Ward,</hi> whoſe innocence could not defend him againſt thoſe wrathful Enemies, with his undaunted appearance againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> had ſtirred up againſt him; He retired to <hi>Mr Bateman's</hi> Houſe, and was, by him concealed, until diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by that <hi>Blood-hound Atterbury.</hi>

            <p>About that time (viz.) in <hi>June,</hi> 1683, the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> had brought <hi>Keeling's Plot</hi> upon the Stage; and thereupon, <hi>Mr. Bateman</hi> was taken up by <hi>Atterbury,</hi> and carried before <hi>King Charles</hi> the ſecond, and there accuſed by<note n="*" place="margin">He ſwore many of his Neighbours into Priſons and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, tho' till now (<hi>Rouſe</hi> excepted) no man was ever tryed upon his Evidence.</note>

            <p>That Mr <hi>Bateman,</hi> was a Perſon of very good ſenſe and underſtanding, will not be denyed, by any Man to whom he was known, but by the rigour, ſeverity and inhumane uſage, wherewith he was treated, during his long Impriſonment; he was found, at the time of his Tryal to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:35279:113"/>be very much ſhattered in his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and very uncapable of making a defence; and that defence which he made, was by the aſſiſtance of his Son, a very young Man, of about twenty years of age.</p>

            <p>That the matter relating to <hi>Sr William Turner,</hi> may appear in it its true Light; I ſhall ſubjoyn the following accompt thereof.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Bateman's Son,</hi> having (as he thought) very providentially heard, that <hi>Baker</hi> had, about two Years before, given an <hi>Information,</hi> upon Oath, to <hi>Sr William Turner,</hi> of the <hi>Villain Lee's</hi> tampering with him, to enſnare and accuſe <hi>Mr Bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> was adviſed by <hi>Counſel,</hi> to apply himſelf to <hi>Sr William;</hi> and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral attendances upon him, when he was engaged in other matters, and his Books of Entries lay upon his Table; he turning over the Leaves, found the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Baker</hi>'s <hi>Information,</hi> about <hi>Lee</hi>'s attempting to ſuborn him, againſt Mr <hi>Bateman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Son</hi> thereupon, in the firſt place, applied to <hi>Tomkins,</hi> Sr <hi>William</hi>'s <hi>Clerk,</hi> to get a Copy of that <hi>Information;</hi> and did once think him inclined to let him have it; but at laſt, he told him he muſt ask <hi>Sr William:</hi> Thereupon he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:35279:116"/>to <hi>Sr William</hi> for it, who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him, <hi>Whether it were againſt the King;</hi> and <hi>young Mr Bateman</hi> anſwered him, <hi>No; it may ſave the Life of one of his Subjects;</hi> whereupon <hi>Sr William</hi> ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Refuge then was, to ſubpena <hi>Sr William Turner,</hi> and his <hi>Clerk;</hi> which was done; and <hi>Sr William</hi> being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, &amp; ſaying, he could not charge his Memory with any of the particulars in the Information of <hi>Baker;</hi> young <hi>Mr Bateman</hi> ſaid, Let the Book be ſent for, it is in ſuch a Book, and ſuch a Page.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, <hi>Herbert</hi> the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> in a paſſion, commanded young Mr <hi>Bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to be removed out of the Court, as he was.</p>
            <p>If the truth of what is here related, in reference to <hi>Sr William Turner,</hi> be any way doubted, it will evidently, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond controul appear, by the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings before the <hi>Houſe of Lords,</hi> where it hath been very lately made out, by <hi>Mr Bateman</hi>'s <hi>Son,</hi> and alſo by another Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who was privy to the whole tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action thereof, with <hi>Sr William Turner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Bateman</hi> being thus condemned to Death, by the foregoing wicked Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:35279:117"/>expreſſed himſelf thus to his Son, <hi>Richard, Your Father needs not to dye, if he will accuſe others, but he dyes becauſe he will not be a Rogue.</hi> And 'twas moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true, as 'tis, that a greater Rogue lives not, than this <hi>Lee,</hi> (Mr <hi>Bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> firſt Accuſer) who having miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his curſed Attempt to ſuborn <hi>Baker,</hi> is now ſeconded by <hi>Goodenough,</hi> who was brought with a <hi>Halter</hi> (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) about his Neck, to ſwear this good Man out of his Life.</p>
            <p>In relation to the Witneſſes and their Evidence, ſome things deſerve to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remarked.</p>
            <p>The late <hi>King James</hi> had no ſooner poſſeſſed himſelf of the Throne, but by his order, and ſpecial recommendation, a moſt malitious Tract was emitted to the World, under the Title of <hi>Atrue Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and Declaration of the horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy againſt the late</hi> King, <hi>his preſent</hi> Majeſty, <hi>and the</hi> Government; The temporizing <hi>Pen-man</hi> (who ever he was) ſhewed more Art than Honeſty, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling that Hiſtory, and omitted nothing therein, which might ſerve the turn of <hi>Popery;</hi> but moſt wickedly magnified
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:35279:117"/>the Evidence of the <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> he treated of. His looſe and virulent Pen runs thus, as to <hi>Keeling,</hi> one of the Witneſſes in the caſe before us;</p>
            <p>Joſia Keeling <hi>(a moſt perverſe Fanatick) was the Man whom God choſe to make the firſt diſcoverer; It pleaſed the divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo to touch his Soul, that he could not reſt till after much conflict in his mind, he had fully determined to diſcharge his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Helliſh Secret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the truth of it is, <hi>Keeling</hi> was found, about that time, to be under ſome Conflict; but it was with <hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>Inſtruments;</hi> who quickly vanquiſhed and made him a Witneſs; as hath been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made out beyond contradiction; by the Teſtimony of many unblemiſhed Perſons, before the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> (of which more in it is proper place) he had indeed before that time, frequented an Aſſembly of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who diſſented from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but being thrown out <hi>(as a perverſe Fanatick)</hi> he made his way by a Profligate Fellow, like himſelf, one <hi>Peckham;</hi> to Sr <hi>Leoline Jenkins</hi> the Secretary of State, who liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his <hi>Church,</hi> and the firſt in his Roll of <hi>Witneſſes;</hi> and ſince he became ſo,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:35279:118"/>'tis notoriouſly known, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up himſelf to all manner of Vices, and is a prophane lewd <hi>debauchee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Keeling</hi> is brought in as the firſt Witneſs againſt <hi>Mr Bateman;</hi> tho' his Evidence, touch'd him no more in Law, than it did every of the Jury-men; and it is remarkable,<note place="margin">Page 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the true Account, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> that in the four Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times gave in to <hi>Jenkins,</hi> Mr <hi>Bateman</hi> is not ſo much as once named, and yet we here find <hi>Keeling</hi> a witneſs againſt him.</p>
            <p>The fore-mentioned bitter and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious Hiſtory doth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſent us at large,<note place="margin">Page 34. of the true Account, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> (as it did <hi>Keeling</hi>'s) with the Information of <hi>Lee</hi> the <hi>dyer,</hi> againſt <hi>Mr Bateman;</hi> therein <hi>Lee</hi> ſwears, that he told <hi>Mr B.</hi> a ſtory he had from <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough,</hi> of our Rights and Priviledges being invaded; and that ſome <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> had taken into conſideration, how to retrive them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Mr Bateman</hi> thereupon told him, he muſt have a care, and ſpeak at a great diſtance; that he was willing to aſſiſt, <hi>if he could ſee but a Cloud as big as a Man's hand;</hi> And that <hi>Mr B.</hi> told him, that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:35279:118"/>told him the ſaid <hi>Mr B. that he was glad that he came acquainted with thoſe</hi> Proteſtant Lords; and that <hi>Mr B.</hi> aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Lee,</hi> that the <hi>Duke was very right for the</hi> Proteſtant Intereſt; <hi>and that we need not miſtruſt him;</hi> And <hi>Lee</hi> added, in that <hi>Information, That</hi> Goodenough <hi>told him, that they muſt ſeize the Tower, and take the City, and ſecure the</hi> Savoy <hi>and</hi> White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, <hi>and the King and the Duke.</hi>

            <p>The Caſe, as to poor <hi>Mr Bateman,</hi> was much altered, between the time of <hi>Lee</hi>'s giving the foregoing Information, and this Tryal; for at firſt, the <hi>mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> were for hanging <hi>Goodenough,</hi> (of whom, the Author of <hi>the True Account,</hi> pag. 55. ſaith, that he, with monſtrous Impiety, maintained and recommended the Murder of the King and the Duke, as a pious deſign, and a keeping of one of the ten Commandments, and the beſt way to prevent ſhedding <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Blood) rather than <hi>Bateman;</hi> and to that end, <hi>Lee's</hi> main force was then bent againſt <hi>Goodenough;</hi> but now, it being found, that <hi>Goodenough</hi> (and the City-<hi>Juries</hi> of that day) could hang Alderman <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Bateman</hi> (and alſo Sr. <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> could they have catcht him) the ſtory,

            <p>As matters were at firſt concerted, the Evidence ran thus, <hi>Goodenough</hi> told <hi>Lee, that they muſt ſeize and ſecure the</hi> Tower, <hi>the</hi> City, <hi>the</hi> Savoy, Whitehall; <hi>the</hi> King <hi>and the</hi> Duke; Now <hi>Lee</hi> ſwears (and <hi>Goodenough</hi> backs him in it) that all this diſcourſe of ſeizing and ſecuring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceeded from Mr <hi>Bateman.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Crag</hi> returned with anſwer, <hi>that they could not aſſiſt them with Money,</hi> for that they did not know, to what end they ſhould have Money, but to buy Arms, and for that the People were well provided already.

            <p>That before <hi>Crag's</hi> going laſt away, <hi>Jones</hi> came over, to know why <hi>VVe</hi> ſtay'd ſo long; and he was diſpatched to acquaint them, the <hi>Duke</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and was directed to <hi>Major Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> and amongſt the reſt, to my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> to raiſe what Forces they could to aſſiſt him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>High Steward</hi> replyed, That is pretty ſtrange, ſo famous an Under-Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> as he was.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> being next ſworn, teſtified, That he went to <hi>Holland</hi> (where he had buſineſs) about the latter end of <hi>April</hi> laſt.</p>
            <p>That Mr <hi>Diſney</hi> had darkly communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him, that there were intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of doing ſomething; and deſiring to know more of the Deſign, the night before he went, he acquainted <hi>Diſney</hi> with his intended Journey, and that he intended to ſee the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and if he had any Meſſage to him, he would deliver it ſafely.</p>
            <p>That Mr <hi>Diſney</hi> told him all the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he ſhould deliver, was, To deſire the <hi>Duke</hi> to keep to the laſt concluſion, which he would find in a Letter, that had been ſent to him, by the <hi>Crop-hair'd Merchant;</hi> which Meſſage was, That the <hi>Duke's</hi> Friends, would not by any means have him come for <hi>England,</hi> but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:35279:127"/>to continue where he was; or if he thought fit to go for <hi>Scotland</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it.</p>
            <p>That when <hi>Jones</hi> came to the <hi>Duke,</hi> and delivered the Meſſage, he was in a great Paſſion, and reflected very much on <hi>Major Wildman,</hi> and ſaid, 'twas too late to ſend ſuch a Meſſage now, for he was reſolved to come for <hi>England,</hi> and would make <hi>Wildman Hang with him, or Fight for it,</hi> with him; That <hi>Wildman</hi> did think by tying his own Purſe, to tye his Hands, but he ſhould find it ſhould not be ſo.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Duke</hi> told him, Money was very ſhort, <hi>and he had pawned all he had, to raiſe what Money was raiſed;</hi> That he would be glad <hi>Jones</hi> ſhould return to <hi>England,</hi> as ſoon as he could; and that he ſhould tell <hi>Wildman,</hi> that he would come for <hi>England,</hi> and he ſhould either Fight with him, or Hang with him; and that was all he had to ſay to him.</p>
            <p>That going again to the <hi>Duke,</hi> the ſame evening, he told him he would have him ſtay till Tueſday morning; That then (the <hi>Duke</hi> being gone out of Town) the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> told <hi>Jones</hi> from the <hi>Duke;</hi> That he intended to be in

               <hi>England</hi> within nine days; and bid him remember to tell <hi>Brand, that when he heard the</hi> Duke <hi>was Landed, he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint</hi> Sr Robert Peyton <hi>with it, but not till he was Landded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Jones</hi> miſſing paſſage to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from <hi>Roterdam,</hi> he returned to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> and went to the <hi>Duke,</hi> and told him the reaſon why he was not gone; and the <hi>Duke</hi> ſaid he was glad he was not gone, for he had a further Meſſage, and would have him ſtay two or three days.</p>
            <p>That upon the 21ſt of <hi>May,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> ordered him to come to him in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when he came, the <hi>Duke</hi> took a Paper that lay upon the Table, and ſenſed it, and told him, that when he came to <hi>London,</hi> he muſt ſee for <hi>Captain Mathews,</hi> and deſire him to acquaint my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> my Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> that he was reſolved to ſet out the next <hi>Saturday</hi> morning.</p>

            <p>That <hi>Jones</hi> askt the <hi>Duke,</hi> what he was to do with the Paper, who ſaid, I do by you, as <hi>Princes</hi> do by their <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> they have their Commiſſions ſealed up, and not to open them till at Sea; ſo I deliver your Inſtructions ſealed up, which you are not to open till you are at Sea; and when you have opened and read what is contained in them, I would have you tear the Paper, and throw it into the Sea, leaſt you be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized and fearched at your Landing; And that the <hi>Duke</hi> ordered him, that if he miſſed of <hi>Captain Mathews,</hi> he ſhould deliver the Meſſage to Major <hi>Wildman.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Taunton <hi>is the place to which all are to reſort, The Perſons to be acquainted with the time of Landing are the</hi> Lord Macclesfield, <hi>the</hi> Lord Brandon, <hi>and the</hi> Lord Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere. <hi>The place to ſend the Coach to, is to</hi> Mr Savage's, <hi>the</hi> Red Lyon; <hi>The Poſt is to return to</hi> Captain Mathews, <hi>or as he ſhall appoint.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>I ſuppoſe</hi> I told Mr <hi>Storey</hi> of it firſt, at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> after I was taken Priſoner for the Rebellion: and <hi>I think</hi> it was a forthnight, after my acquaintance with him, (I lay with him in the ſame Bed.)</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord D.</hi> demanded <hi>when was the firſt time he made Oath of this, and upon what occaſion?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> ſaid, I remained a Priſoner at <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> from the 10th of <hi>July</hi> to the beginning of the laſt <hi>Term,</hi> when I was

               <hi>My Lord D.</hi> then demanded, <hi>Whether ever he had employed him about any of his Concerns, that ſhould give him an occaſion of truſting him with ſuch Secrets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>I never was in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany but only then;</hi> and then, as recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by my <hi>Lord Brandon;</hi> for they ſaid; they muſt make uſe of ſuch as me, to make their Deſigus known to the Country, for the accompliſhing what they did intend.</p>
            <p>I was to inform the Country of the time of Riſing; my Acquaintance aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that way; and by their diſcourſe, they had got Men in every place, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Country when they ſhould riſe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>I askt his Name, but the would not tell me;</hi> he ſaid he was a

            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord D.</hi> demanded what time of day or night it was, when he came to his Houſe; and whether, when he came, he alighted at the Stables or not; and who took his Horſe; and at what Door he was let in; and who let him into the Houſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> ſaid, It was juſt when it began to be dark; that he alighted juſt at the Old Buildings; and that the Man that eaine with him, took his Horſe; and he went into the Houſe, and brought out a Candle; that he never was at the Houſe before, and cannot tell which Door he went in at; That the Man went with him juſt to the Door, and let him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Door; and <hi>he ſaw no other man, but that man, till he came into the Room, where my Lord; and the two Gentlemen were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord D.</hi> asked him, whether no body elſe but they were there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> anſwer'd. No; you were ſo wiſe, you would let no Body be by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr</hi> Attorney then ſaid, <hi>My Lord,</hi> We
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:35279:134"/>ſhall give no more evidence at preſent, but ſhall reſt here, till <hi>We</hi> ſee what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence this <hi>Noble Lord</hi> will make for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord Delamere</hi> then proceeded, ſaying, <hi>May it pleaſe your Grace,</hi> and you <hi>my Lords;</hi> It is an Offence of a very high nature for which I am this day to anſwer, before your <hi>Lordſhips;</hi> yet I thank <hi>God,</hi> I am not affraid to ſpeak in this place, becauſe I am not only very well aſſured of my own innocence, but alſo well aſſured of your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Juſtice, which cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, or ſurprized by <hi>Inſtnuations and ſlorid Har angues,</hi> nor governed by any thing but the Juſtice of the Cauſe. —I think that in matters relating to the <hi>Church,</hi> and the things injoyned therein, few have conformed more in practiſe, than I have done; and yet I am not aſhamd to ſay, that <hi>I have always a ten derneſs for all thoſe who could not keep pace with me;</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> for thoſe that have out gone me, and differed from me, tho' never ſo far, nay, tho' of a <hi>different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> for I always thought <hi>Religion lay more in Charity than Perſecution.</hi>—In every publick Truſt, I was faithful in
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:35279:135"/>the diſcharge of it, for <hi>I never voted nor ſpoke in any manner but as my Conſcience and Judgment did dictate to me. I have always made the</hi> Laws <hi>the meaſure of my</hi> Loyalty,—and have endeavoured as far as in me lay, to live peaceably with all men.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>my Lords,</hi> was not only the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of my own Inclination, but it was <hi>the Principle of my Father,</hi> and the Leſſon that he taught me— Whoſoever did know him, I dare ſay did believe him to be a good Man. For my part, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured always to imitate his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and that I hope, will go very far, to vindicate me from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being inclined to any ſuch Crime as I ſtand charged with.</p>
            <p>Here have been a great many <hi>Witneſſes, and a great deal of Swearing,</hi> but little or nothing of legal Evidence to affect me; for there is but one Man that faith any thing, home and poſitively againſt me; All the reſt are but <hi>Hear-ſays,</hi> and ſuch remote Circumſtances as may be tack'd to any Evidence, againſt any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but are urged againſt me, for want of greater matters to charge me with; and therefore, I hope the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:35279:135"/>&amp; preſſing of theſe things againſt me, is rather a ſtrong Argument that I am innocent, and that <hi>there have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous and ill Deſigns of ſome againſt me;</hi> than that I am guilty: <hi>Had they had geater matters,</hi> your Lordſhips <hi>would have been ſure to have heard of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> when he ſate in the ſame place, that your <hi>Grace</hi> does now, at the Tryal of my <hi>Lord Cornwallis,</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Peers,</hi> had this paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know your Lordſhips will weigh the fact with all its Circumſtances, from which it is to receive its true and its proper doom; your Lordſhips are too juſt, to let pitty make any abatement for the Crime, and too wiſe, to ſuffer Rhethorick to make any Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; This only will be neceſſary to be obſerved by all your Lordſhips, That</hi> the fouler the Crime is, the clearer and plainer ought the proof of it to be 3 <hi>There is no other</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">'Tis then great pitty that the Law, as to this is not altered, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Engliſh</hi> man (who may have what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel he will in a Cauſe of 40 <hi>s.</hi> value) allowed Counſel, when he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerded for his Life.</note> 
               <hi>good reaſon can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, why the Law refuſeth to allow the Priſoner at the Bar Counſel, in matter
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:35279:136"/>
of Fact, when Life is concerned, but only this; becauſe the Evidence, by which he is condemned, ought to be ſo very evident, and ſo plain, that all the Counſel in the World ſhould not be able to anſwer it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> I think the Evidence given againſt me doth not come up to this; and I hope your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> will regard this of my <hi>Lord Nottingham's,</hi> as more worthy of your conſideration, than the fine <hi>Flouriſhings</hi> and <hi>Inſinuations</hi> of the <hi>King's Council,</hi> which tend <hi>(if it be not ſo deſign'd)</hi> rather <hi>to miſguide</hi> your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> than to lead you to find out the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> I ſhall begin with <hi>Saxon,</hi> for he I perceive is the great <hi>Goliah,</hi> whoſe evidence is to maintain this <hi>Accuſation,</hi> and if I cut him down, I ſuppoſe I ſhall be thought to have done my own buſineſs; I ſhall firſt call ſome of his Neighbours who have converſed with him, and know him.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> then called Six Witneſſes, who proved <hi>Saxon</hi> to be a very ill Man, and to have been guilty of Forgeries, and ſeveral Cheats.</p>
            <p>That being done, his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> ſaid, I
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:35279:136"/>ſhall paſs over this part of my Evidence, tho' I have many more Witneſſes to this point, and come to matter of fact, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter this poſitive proof againſt me.</p>

               <hi>Saxon</hi> has teſtified, that about the 3d or 4th of <hi>June,</hi> he <hi>(as on extraordinary Perſon, being confided in)</hi> was ſent for by me, to <hi>Mere,</hi> where he found me, <hi>Sr Robert Cotton</hi> and <hi>Mr Offley; who employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to tranſact the ſtiring up the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to riſe and joyn with the</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> M.

            <p>Mr <hi>Billing</hi> (Sr <hi>Robert Cotton's</hi> Steward) teſtified, that Sr <hi>Robert</hi> came to <hi>London</hi> the 10th of <hi>April</hi> laſt, and that he ſaw him conſtantly once or twice a day; That <hi>about the end of July,</hi> he went for three dayes to <hi>Epſam,</hi> and came to Town again, and continued here, till he was committed to the Tower, and never was in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> ſince the 6th of <hi>April</hi> laſt.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> catcht hold of this, ſaying, <hi>You ſay he did not go out of Town till</hi>

            <p>Mr <hi>Booth</hi> my Lord <hi>Delamer's</hi> Brother proved that he ſaw my Lord in Town, the 3d of <hi>June</hi> in the evening, and alſo the 4th, 5th, 6th, and ſo on to the 10th of <hi>June,</hi> ſometimes twice or thrice a day.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>George Booth,</hi> another of my <hi>Lord's Brothers</hi> teſtified, that he ſaw my <hi>Lord</hi>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:35279:138"/>in Town, the 4th of <hi>June,</hi> by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioular circumſtance, that he went with him, the next day, to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> to hear my <hi>Lord Maccleſſield's</hi> Cauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Fitton's</hi> Appeale.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord Lovlace</hi> proved that he ſaw my <hi>Lord D.</hi> in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> at the hearing of my <hi>Lord Maccleſfield's</hi> Cauſe (the 5th of <hi>June</hi>) and that my <hi>Lord D.</hi> ſtood by the Bar, and took notes.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord D.</hi> then ſaid, I hope I have now ſatisfied your <hi>Grace,</hi> and the reſt of my <hi>Lords,</hi> that none of us three, whom this Fellow has mentioned, were at that time at <hi>Mere,</hi> when hé ſaid we were. I affirm in the preſence of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> that I have not ſeen <hi>Sr Robert Cotton</hi> at my Houſe theſe many years, and I believe Mr <hi>Offley</hi> was never there ſince I was Maſter of it: and I do proteſt, that, to my knowledge, <hi>I never ſaw the Face of this Man till now:</hi> I am ſure I never ſpoke with him, nor ſent for him to my Houſe.</p>
            <p>If his Story be conſidered, it will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear to be very improbable, for he neither tells, who the Meſſenger was, that was ſent for him, nor the way that he came into the Houſe, and he muſt needs diſcern which way he came in, for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:35279:138"/>I have but one Door into my Houſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that by the Stables, which is a great way off the Houſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>my Lords,</hi> Is it probable, that he ſhould ſee no Body ſtiring about the Houſe, except the <hi>Man without a Hand,</hi> that he ſayes was ſent for him? I aſſure your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> I have not, nor had my Father ever, that I know of, any <hi>Servant</hi> or <hi>Tenant,</hi> that was maimed in the manner he ſpeaks of; Is it to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined that I would take a Man I knew nothing of, into ſo great a confidence, as to employ him about a buſineſs of this nature? I beſeech your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> to look at him; <hi>Is this</hi> Fellow <hi>a likely</hi> Fellow <hi>to be uſed in ſuch an affair? Does he look as if he were fit to be employed for the raiſing</hi> 10000 Men? your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> likewiſe ſee, that he is ſo well thought of, <hi>that he dare not be truſted out of</hi> Newgate; but is kept ſtill a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> and as ſuch, gives evidence here; <hi>He Swears to ſave himſelf, and would fain exchange his Life for mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> The <hi>King's Council</hi> lay a great weight upon my going down the 27th of <hi>May,</hi> and my <hi>frequent riding Poſt;</hi> I ſhall ſatisfie your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:35279:139"/>Reaſons of my <hi>Journies;</hi> the firſt time I went to take Poſſeſſion of a <hi>Leaſe</hi> of ſix or ſeven Thouſand pounds value, which was renewed to me by the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop;</hi> and I had word that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> was ill, and that obliged me to make haſt down.</p>
            <p>All this being fully proved by <hi>Mr Edmond's</hi> and Mr <hi>Henry;</hi> my <hi>Lord Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> proceeded, ſaying, I had reſolved to go ſee a ſick <hi>Child,</hi> but hod not taken my journey ſo ſoon as the 27th of <hi>May,</hi> nor with ſuch privacy; but that I had notice there was a <hi>Warrant</hi> to apprehend me; and I was willing to keep out of cuſtody, as long as I could; Being at my Houſe in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> my <hi>Wife</hi> ſent me an <hi>Expreſs,</hi> that, as to the <hi>Warrant, She</hi> hoped it was a miſtake; but my <hi>Eldeſt Son</hi> was very ill, and if I intended to ſee him alive, I muſt make haſte up; This was the occaſion of my quick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>Mrs <hi>Kelſey</hi> then witneſſed, that my <hi>Lord</hi> came to his Houſe in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> the 31ſt of <hi>May</hi> being Sunday, and that his Child was ill; and my <hi>Lord</hi> told her,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:35279:139"/>that he heard there was a <hi>Warrant</hi> to take him up; That he ſtayed Monday the 1ſt of <hi>June,</hi> and went away on Tueſday morning.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lady Delamere</hi> (my <hi>Lord's Mother</hi>) teſtified the Child's being ill in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that while my <hi>Lord</hi> was there, his <hi>Lady</hi> ſent for him <hi>Poſt,</hi> if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſee his eldeſt <hi>Son</hi> alive.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Kelſey</hi> proved, That my <hi>Lor<hi rend="sup">d</hi> D.</hi> came down upon the <hi>Sunday</hi> night, at eleven of the Clock; and ſtay'd at home all <hi>Munday,</hi> and on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> at three in the Morning, he took Horſe for <hi>London;</hi> and that Mr <hi>Kelſey</hi> had Letters from my <hi>Lady Delamere,</hi> and <hi>Mrs Vere Booth;</hi> dated the 4th of <hi>June;</hi> that told him my <hi>Lord</hi> was come to Town the night before.</p>
            <p>Sr <hi>Thomas Millington</hi> (the Phyſitian) witneſſed; that upon the 28th of <hi>May,</hi> he was ſent for to my <hi>Lord Delamere's Son,</hi> and found him very ill, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo two dayes, and he told my <hi>Lady Delamere,</hi> that he thought the Child would not eſcape. That he knows punctually this was the time, by
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:35279:140"/>the <hi>Apothecaries Bills,</hi> which he wrote, and finds the date on them.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord Delamere</hi> then ſaid, My <hi>Lord,</hi> I hope I have given their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> ſatisfaction in all points, and need to give no further Evidence.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge I did go at that time privately a By-Road, by the name of <hi>Brown;</hi> as for <hi>Jones,</hi> I appeal to him himſelf, and call <hi>God</hi> to witneſs, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw the Man before now, in my Life; All that has been ſaid againſt me, (except what this <hi>Fellow Saxon</hi> teſtifies) is but <hi>Hear-ſay, nay indeed but Hear-ſay upon Hear-ſay,</hi> at the third and fourth Hand.</p>
            <p>It is at the pleaſure of any two Men in the World, to take away the Lives, Honours &amp; Eſtates of any of your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> if it be a proof ſufficient to make you guilty of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> for them to ſwear you were intended to be drawn into <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, <hi>my Lords,</hi> I muſt leave my Caſe to the conſideration of your <hi>Lordſhips; I am not Maſter of ſo much Law or Rhetorick as the Kings Council, to plead in my own Cauſe;</hi> But I hope what
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:35279:140"/>Evidence I have offered, has given your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> full ſatisfaction that <hi>I am not Guilty,</hi> of what I ſtand charged with.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> I would beg you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, that if I, with thoſe other two <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that he has named, had had any tranſactions of this kind with ſuch a Fellow as <hi>Saxon;</hi> ſo as at firſt ſight, to put ſuch large confidence in him; Can it be imagined I ſo little regarded my own Life, and all that is dear to me; as to have ſurrender'd my ſelf; were it not, that I was certain of my own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and integrity? <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf, my <hi>Lords,</hi> is to be preferred above all things, but <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Innocence;</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Skin for Skin, and all that a Man hath will he give for his Life;</hi> and why ſhould I be preſumed to have ſo little a value for it, as voluntarily to deliver up my ſelf to deſtruction; had I been Conſcious that there was any one, who could really teſtifie any thing that could hurt me?</p>
            <p>Beſides, my <hi>Lords;</hi> This very <hi>Fellow Saxon,</hi> is but one Evidence; and ſurely, <hi>one Witneſs</hi> will never be ſufficient to convict a Man of <hi>Treaſon, tho' thouſands
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:35279:141"/>of Hear-ſays,</hi> and ſuch trivial circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be tack'd to it; eſpecially, when tack'd to an evidence, which, I dare ſay, your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> are far from thinking it deſerves credit.</p>
            <p>Would not any of your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> think himſelf in a very bad Condition as to his Fortune, if he could produce no better Evidence to prove his Title to his Eſtate, than what has been now produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, to take away my Life, and if ſuch <hi>Evidence</hi> as this, would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport a Title to an Eſtate, certainly it can never be thought ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to deprive a Man of <hi>Life, Honour, Eſtate and All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords, God</hi> knows how ſoon the Misfortune of a <hi>falſe Accuſation</hi> may fall to the Lot of any of your <hi>Lordſhips;</hi> ſince that may happen; I queſtion not but your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> will be very cautious, how, by an eaſie Credulity, you give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſuch a Wickedneſs; For <hi>Knights of the Poſt will not end in my Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, if they proſper in their Villany; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may come home to ſome of your</hi> Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, <hi>if ſuch Practices be encouraged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> the Eyes of all the Nation are upon your Proceedings this day; Nay
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:35279:141"/>I may ſay, your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> are now judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cauſe of every Man in <hi>England,</hi> that ſhall hereafter happen to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the like Circumſtances with my ſelf; For <hi>accordingly as you Judge of me now, juſt ſo will Inferiour Courts be directed to give their Judgment in time to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> very well know, Blood once ſpilt can never be gather'd up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and therefore, you, I am ſure, will not hazard the ſheding of my Blood upon a doubtful Evidence;—If it ſhould be <hi>indifferent,</hi> or but <hi>doubtful</hi> to your <hi>Lordſhips (which upon my Proofs, I cannot believe it can be)</hi> whether I am <hi>Innocent</hi> or <hi>Guilty;</hi> Both <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> require you to acquit me.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> I leave my ſelf, My Cauſe, and all the Conſequences of it, with your <hi>Lordſhips;</hi> And I pray the <hi>All-wiſe, the Almighty God,</hi> to direct you in your determination.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Solicitor General</hi> then ſaid, May it pleaſe your <hi>Grace,</hi> and you my <hi>Noble Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Evidence againſt this <hi>Noble Lord</hi> is of two Natures, part of it is poſitive Proof and part is Circumſtantial, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:35279:142"/>tho' it be allowed, that <hi>there muſt be two Witneſſes in caſes of Treaſon;</hi> and that Circumſtances, tho' never ſo ſtrong to fortifie one poſitive proof, cannot make a ſecond poſitive Witneſs; yet, I crave leave to ſay, that <hi>there may be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſo ſtrong &amp; cogent, ſo violent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to fortifie a poſitive Teſtimony; That will in Law amount to make a ſecond Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſuch as the Law requires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lords,</hi> If a man comes and ſwears againſt another, That he ſaid, he will go and kill the <hi>King,</hi> and another Man, that did not heare theſe words, teſtifies his lying in wait; That Circumſtance of lying in wait, that was an Action indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in it ſelf, when applied to the poſitive Proof, will be a ſecond Witneſs to ſatisfie the Law.</p>
            <p>It is not my <hi>duty</hi> to carry the <hi>Evidence</hi> in this Caſe, <hi>further than it will go;</hi> and <hi>I am ſure it is not my Duty, to let it loſe any of its Weight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Lord;</hi> Our poſitive prooff, is but one ſingle Witneſs, and that is <hi>Saxon,</hi> (Mr <hi>Solicitor then repeated his Evidence, and went on ſaying</hi>) This, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſtanding ſingle, will make but one Witneſs; but <hi>whether the Circumſtances
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:35279:142"/>that have been offered by the other Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, be ſuch violent Circumſtances, as neceſſarily tend to fortifie and ſupport that poſitive Evidence, and ſo will ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a ſecond Witneſs; is the next Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I come to conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Solicitor</hi> then repeated the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and Mr <hi>Jones; (how truly let any who will be at the trouble of reading the Tryal at large, judge)</hi> and proceeded ſaying, Here, my <hi>Lord,</hi> is the main Circumſtance that renders the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuſpitious;<note place="margin">But, tho it was not obſerved in ſhe whole Proceeding of the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>Vaux</hi> witneſſed, that my Lord ſent to him, and engaged him the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> to go out of Town with him the next day.</note> That very night that <hi>Jones</hi> came to Town (the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>May</hi>) does my Lord <hi>Delamere,</hi> at ten at Night, go out of Town, under the diſguiſe of the Name of <hi>Brown,</hi> and a By-Road, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> this I ſay, is the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that renders the thing ſuſpitious.</p>
            <p>But now, my <hi>Lords,</hi> comes the <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>main Queſtion,</hi> how it is made out, that my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> had notice, <hi>Jones</hi> brought the Meſſage from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jones</hi> indeed does not ſay that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted it to him, But <hi>Story</hi> ſays that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:35279:143"/>
               <hi>Brand,</hi> who knew of the Meſſage, <hi>did acquaint him, that my</hi> Lord <hi>had received it at the Coffee-Houſe, and that Night went out of Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, this is but a hear-ſay, but that which followed, being matter of Fact; My <hi>Lord's</hi> going out of Town that Night, and in ſuch an unuſual ſuſpitious manner, gives more credit to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than, as a bare hear-ſay, could have of it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For unleſs there be a good account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of my <hi>Lord's</hi> thus going out of Town; it is a kind of neceſſary preſumption, that he acquainted him with the Meſſage; and if ſo, it can have no other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, than to be in purſuance of the directions brought him from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing, my <hi>Lords,</hi> that ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this matter ſuſpitious, is, the Name which my <hi>Lord</hi> aſſumed; <hi>a Name by which the Party uſed to call my Lord;</hi> which is proved by <hi>Babington</hi> and <hi>Paunchforth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paunchforth</hi> tells you, that one <hi>Lock</hi> came for ſome of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth's Declarations,</hi> for Mr <hi>Brown,</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> So that tho' ſome body elſe was called by the Name of <hi>Browne</hi>
               <pb n="265" facs="tcp:35279:143"/>yet you have had no account given you, that there was any other <hi>Brown</hi> in <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very ſuſpitious, that if my <hi>Lord</hi> went into <hi>Cheſhire</hi> under the name of <hi>Brown,</hi> and ſome came on <hi>Brown's</hi> behalf, for <hi>Declarations</hi> to be ſent into <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> and my <hi>Lord</hi> commonly, with that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, went by that Name; <hi>That will be a great Evidence of his Correſpondence with</hi> Monmouth.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, my <hi>Lords,</hi> all this while, our proof is circumſtantial; and indeed there is no poſitive proof, but that of <hi>Saxon's;</hi> and here I muſt confeſs there are Objections made, which I cannot readily anſwer—There is no good account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, what reaſon there was for ſo many <hi>Poſt-Journeys,</hi> backward and forward;—Theſe are matters of ſuſpition; But I confeſs matters of ſuſpition only, unleſs clear, poſitive, probable proof be joyned with them, will not weigh with your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> to convict a Man of <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> but whether theſe matters of ſuſpition, be ſuch violent and neceſſary preſumptions, as tend to fortifie the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Teſtimony, I muſt leave that to the conſideration of your <hi>Lordſhips.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="266" facs="tcp:35279:144"/>
            <p>The <hi>High Steward</hi> then concluded, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my <hi>Lords,</hi> There is ſomething I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit taking notice of, that one miſtake in point of Law might not go unrectified; <hi>viz. That there is a neceſſity in point of Law, that there ſhould be two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Witneſſes to convict a Man of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without all doubt, what was urged by hat learned <hi>Gentleman</hi> who conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the <hi>King,</hi> is true; There may be ſuch other ſubſtantial Circumſtances, joyned to one poſitive Teſtimony; that by the Opinion of all the Judges, has been ſeveral times adjudged to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Proof.</p>
            <p>As in this Caſe; If your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> ſhould believe <hi>Saxon</hi> ſwears true; and ſhall believe there was that Circumſtance of <hi>Jone's</hi> coming over from <hi>Holland,</hi> with ſuch a <hi>Meſſage</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>May (which is directly ſworn in Evidence)</hi> and what the other Witneſſes have ſworn likewiſe, that my Lord <hi>Delamere</hi> went out of Town <hi>that Night, changed his Name, and went an indirect By-Road; certainly theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;</hi> if your <hi>Lordſhips</hi> be ſatisfied he went for that purpoſe; <hi>do neceſſarily knit the poſitive Teſtimony of</hi> Saxon; <hi>and amount to a ſecond Witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="267" facs="tcp:35279:144"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordſhips are Judges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">'Twas well for my Lord <hi>D.</hi> &amp; amultitude more, that they were ſo; for had his Lordſhip fallen, weſhould not have known where they, would have ſtop'd; and the High.

            </p>
            <p>After this, it happened, the <hi>D. of M.</hi> came in, and had a <hi>Pardon;</hi> but ſeveral coming to ſee him, he ſpoke ſome

            <p>Whereupon, after the King was told this, by a <hi>Lady;</hi> he <hi>would have him confeſs his being concerned in the Plot;</hi> and a <hi>Paper</hi> was drawn to that purpoſe, <hi>which the King would have him ſign,</hi> which he did.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Gentleman</hi> (viz.) <hi>Sr James Forbes,</hi> came to him from the <hi>Duke,</hi> with the Copy of the <hi>Paper</hi> the Duke had ſigned, to own the <hi>Plot;</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw it, he ſaid it was a <hi>Confeſſion</hi>

            <p>He ſaid, he was told by <hi>Sr James Forbes,</hi> that the <hi>D. was in a manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to do it; and perſwaded and overborne

            <p>He was told by <hi>Mr Waller,</hi> who is ſince dead, that the <hi>Duke's owning the</hi> Plot <hi>to the King, was the cauſe of Colonel</hi> Sidney's <hi>death;</hi> for the King ballanced before.</p>
            <p>He was after this, brought to a <hi>Tryal for Miſdemeanour,</hi> and was <hi>convicted</hi> on the <hi>Lord Howard's</hi> evidence. He plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that a <hi>Salvo Contene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento;</hi> but the <hi>Court fined him</hi> 4000 <hi>l.</hi> and to Impriſonment, till the Fine paid, and <hi>ſecurity for the good Behaviour.</hi>

            <p>After this, they put him in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Priſon,</hi> where he was kept ten or eleven Months, very cloſe; then, they contrive a <hi>Writ called a long Writ,</hi> to reach his <hi>Real and Perſonal Eſtate,</hi> whilſt he was thus a Priſoner.</p>
            <p>After this, he heard a <hi>new Witneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,</hi> which was after the defeat of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> He was ſent <hi>Cloſe Priſoner</hi> to the <hi>Tower,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland's Warrant,</hi> and put into ſuch a Room, where he had no conveniency, and with two of the Rudeſt <hi>Warders</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> to lie in the Room with him.</p>
            <p>After ſeven or eight weeks, he was removed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> where he was kept cloſe eleven weeks; his <hi>Friends</hi> offered Money for his Pardon to ſome in power; who were the Lord <hi>Jefferyes</hi> and Mr <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; the ſumm was</hi> 6000 <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>By the help of the Money, on condition he would plead Guilty to his Indictment, he was to come off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Friends adviſed him to it, becauſe

               <p>To draw to (what I have impatiently deſired) a concluſion; It is a ſad Truth, that the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> had long reſolved <hi>to go to hanging work,</hi> &amp; Sr <hi>Roger L' Eſtrange</hi> could more certainly predict the time, than <hi>Mr Gadbury</hi> could that of the <hi>Birth</hi> of his <hi>Prince of Wales;</hi> for at that very Juncture, when it was reſolved, That Sr <hi>Dudley North</hi> muſt be Sr <hi>John Moores Sheriff; We had the direful</hi> Conſequences foretold in the <hi>Obſervator,</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 20. 1682, <hi>Number</hi> 140. in theſe words. <hi>If it ſhould pleaſe God to ſend us</hi> SEASONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE SHERIFFS,<note place="margin">The ſame celebrated <hi>Auther,</hi> told the World whom the eſteemed his <hi>ſeaſonable Sheriffs;</hi> for in his <hi>Obſervator</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 17th 1684. he ſayes; Prithee will thou ſet their <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> their <hi>Pilkington</hi> and <hi>Shnte,</hi> againſt <hi>Our North</hi> and <hi>Rich; Our Daniel</hi> and <hi>Daſhwood;</hi> and ſay which of theſe <hi>Sheriffes</hi> are the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyer Men, to juggle <hi>Proteſtants</hi> out of their Lives.

                  <hi>and faire Play for our money, there are ſet a ſoot ſo many Titles
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:35279:178"/>in competition for the</hi> Gallowes, <hi>that it would be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſettle their</hi> Claimes, <hi>and ſay, who ſhould go firſt.</hi> And We know that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of State in that Reign: But to allow every thing its due weight, and to ſet the Tragedy of that diſmal day In its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Light; I ſha here revive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the <hi>dying Teſtimonys</hi> of very ſerious Perſons who then loſt their Lives, for that <hi>horrid Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the late <hi>Kings Charles and James the Second;</hi> which frighted the <hi>Cheſhire Grand Jury,</hi> and with them, a great part of the <hi>Kingdom, out of their VVits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis well known, that the <hi>VVitneſſes</hi> againſt them, <hi>ſwore for their own Lives,</hi> with halters about their Necks; and its as true, that moſt of the Witneſſes had talk't at a mad rate, in the hearing of ſome of thoſe whom they deſtroyed;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:35279:179"/>But ſee, what thoſe <hi>dying Proteſtants</hi> in a moſt ſolemn manner declared, with their laſt Breath.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Colledge</hi> took it upon his death, That he was never engaged in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Plot</hi> or <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> or the <hi>Government;</hi> or knew of any, <hi>except that of the Papiſts;</hi> That if it had been true, <hi>that he was to have ſeized the</hi> King; <hi>he knew not of ſo much as one ſingle Perſon, that was or would have ſtood by him, in that attempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Captain <hi>VValcot</hi> denyed any deſign of <hi>killing the</hi> King, <hi>or of engaging the</hi> Guards, <hi>whilſt others killed him;</hi> And ſaid, that <hi>the Witneſſes invited him to Meetings,</hi> where ſome things were diſcourſed of, <hi>in order to the aſſerting our Liberties and Properties;</hi> which we lookt upon to be violated and invaded: —That <hi>They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned and perpetually ſolicited him, and then deliver'd him up to be hang'd</hi> — That <hi>They combined together to ſwear him out of his Life, to ſave their own;</hi> and that they might do it effectually, <hi>They contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth.</hi> — That he forgave them, <hi>tho' guilty of his Blood;</hi> But, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, earneſtly <hi>begg'd, That they might be
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:35279:179"/>obſerved, that Remarks might be ſet upon them, whether their end be peace:</hi> and he concluded (with what made <hi>Sr Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> a great deal of <hi>Sport,</hi> but yet <hi>Heaven</hi> has made it good) That <hi>when</hi> God HATH A WORK TO DO, HE WILL NOT WANT Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Holloway</hi> declared, that <hi>Mr Weſt</hi> propoſed the <hi>Aſſaſſination, but none ſeconded him.</hi>—That he could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Mr <hi>Ferguſon</hi> knew any thing of it; and <hi>Holloway</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſhed no Blood;</hi> He being interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, by <hi>Mr Ferguſon's</hi> Friend, <hi>Mr Sheriff Daniel,</hi> whether he knew <hi>Fergu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> He anſwer'd <hi>that he did know him, but knew him to be againſt any deſign of killing the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sr <hi>Tho. Armſtrong,</hi> at his death ſpoke thus; Mr <hi>Attorney</hi> ſaid, <hi>I was accuſed for being one of Thoſe who were to kill the</hi> King; <hi>I take God to witneſs, I never had any ſuch deſign;</hi> nor ever had a thought to take away the <hi>King's</hi> Life; Neither ever had any man the impudence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſo barbarous and baſe a thing to me.</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:35279:180"/>
               <p>Mr <hi>Nelthorp</hi> at his death in 1685, ſaid, <hi>I can with great comfort appeal to the great</hi> God; <hi>before whoſe Tribunal I am to appear; what I did was in the ſincerity of my Heart, thinking it my duty to hazard my Life, for the Preſervation of the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, <hi>and the</hi> Engliſh Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>which I thought invaded, and in great danger to be loſt;</hi> As to the deſign of <hi>Aſſaſſinating</hi> or <hi>Murdering</hi> the late <hi>King,</hi> or his preſent <hi>Majeſty;</hi> it was a thing I always deteſted; and I never was in the leaſt concerned in it; Nor <hi>did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there was ſuch a deſign,</hi>—I dye in Charity with all the World; and can readily and heartily forgive my greateſt Enemies, and even thoſe that have been the Evidence againſt me.</p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Rouſe</hi> declared, that he was told, that <hi>They did not intend to ſpill one drop of Blood;</hi> and affirmed that <hi>Lee,</hi> the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> againſt him, did (by his Evidence) make him the <hi>Author of the very words, that came out of his the ſaid</hi> Lee's <hi>own Mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr <hi>Richard Rumbold</hi> (who at his death, at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> in 1685, was found to be
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:35279:180"/>a very brave Man, &amp; moſt ſerious <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and had been repreſented as <hi>the main Promoter of the Murdering deſign</hi>) with his laſt breath deſired all to believe his <hi>dying Words,</hi> and therewith affirmed; <hi>that he never directly, or indirectly, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a Villany as the death of</hi> King Charles <hi>the</hi> ſecond, <hi>and the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> York; but declared, that <hi>he abhorred the thoughts of ſo horrid an intention:</hi> That he was ſure this <hi>Truth,</hi> would <hi>at the great day,</hi> be manifeſt to <hi>all Men;</hi> And he concluded, that <hi>he dyed in the defence of the juſt Laws and Liberties of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>that for that Cauſe, were every Hair of his Head and Beard a Life, he would joyfully ſacrifice them all;</hi> and wiſht he had a <hi>Limb</hi> for every <hi>Town</hi> in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, theſe ſolemn, ſerious, dying <hi>Declarations, Proteſtations</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals</hi> to the <hi>heart-ſearching God;</hi> have always, out-weighed with me, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of thoſe two or three <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> who ſwore theſe Perſons out of their Lives, and by ſo doing ſaved their own. And I did and do moſt ſtedfaſtly believe, that the only <hi>Plot</hi> in that day, was the ſame, which the <hi>Almighty</hi> has at
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:35279:181"/>length owned, and moſt ſignally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered, in the hand of <hi>our gracious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> and <hi>Rightful Soveraign King William;</hi> I mean, the reſcuing the <hi>Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> from a moſt impetuous Torrent of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny;</hi> wherewith they were very dangerouſly threatned. And methinks it ſhould even convert a <hi>Tory</hi> (unleſs his <hi>Brains</hi> were pick'd out of his <hi>Shull,</hi> by him who pick'd the <hi>Guineas</hi> out of his <hi>Pocket</hi>) when he caſts his Eye upon that appoſite &amp; Emphatical Expreſſion in the <hi>Obſervator, vol.</hi> 2. <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 125. <hi>To deal freely with thee,</hi> TRIMMER, <hi>I have more Faith, in the Words of one dying</hi> Traytor, <hi>under the ſtroke of Iuſtice, than of twenty Living.</hi>
